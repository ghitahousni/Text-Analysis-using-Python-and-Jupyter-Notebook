      "In the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of\n",
      "_Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with\n",
      "an uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on\n",
      "him an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,\n",
      "he knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways\n",
      "self-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of\n",
      "Reason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with\n",
      "an Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that\n",
      "notwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,\n",
      "never so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle\n",
      "Tattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for\n",
      "those rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those\n",
      "insipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,\n",
      "which was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned\n",
      "from the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder\n",
      "full blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty\n",
      "Tempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of\n",
      "the Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He\n",
      "was of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of\n",
      "obliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise\n",
      "Maxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the\n",
      "Dogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite\n",
      "you._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond\n",
      "of no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As\n",
      "he was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient\n",
      "_Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural\n",
      "Philosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of\n",
      "Metaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he\n",
      "knew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that\n",
      "the Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant\n",

      "with some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less\n",
      "hollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I\n",
      "conceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat\n",

      "and the Conversation of select Friends. He was still possess'd of a\n",

      "in a good Taste; where every Artist was welcome, and wherein he\n",
      "enjoy'd all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well\n",
      "wish for. In the Morning, his Library was always open for the Use of\n",
      "the Learned; at Night his Table was fill'd with the most agreeable\n",
      "Companions; but he was soon sensible, by Experience, how dangerous\n",
      "it was to keep learned Men Company. A warm Dispute arose about a\n",
      "certain Law of _Zoroaster_; which prohibited the Eating of Griffins:\n",
      "But to what Purpose said some of the Company, was that Prohibition,\n",
      "since there is no such Animal in Nature? Some again insisted that\n",
      "there must; for otherwise _Zoroaster_ could never have been so weak\n",
      "as to give his Pupils such a Caution. _Zadig_, in order to\n",
      "compromize the Matter, said; Gentlemen, If there are such Creatures\n",
      "in Being, let us never touch them; and if there are not, we are well\n",
      "assur'd we can't touch them; so in either Case we shall comply with\n",

      "associated with the most conversible Men, and the most amiable\n",
      "Ladies in all _Babylon_; he made elegant Entertainments, which were\n",
      "frequently preceded by a Concert of Musick, and enliven'd by the\n",
      "most facetious Conversation, in which, as he had felt the Smart of\n",
      "it, he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit, which is not\n",
      "only the surest Proof that a Man has none, but the most infallible\n",

      "\n",
      "Neither the Choice of his Friends, nor that of his Dishes, was the\n",

      "the Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid\n",
      "Wisdom. It was to him, the Nations round about were indebted for\n",

      "The Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,\n",

      "greatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in\n",
      "regard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and\n",
      "graceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she\n",
      "was at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;\n",
      "yet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the\n",
      "least Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly\n",
      "pleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of\n",
      "her Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was\n",
      "continually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the\n",
      "Subject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who\n",
      "were as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated\n",
      "Discourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,\n",
      "than she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send\n",
      "_Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the\n",
      "Result of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no\n",
      "more of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who\n",
      "was perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and\n",
      "Affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who\n",
      "had such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his\n",

      "if perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of\n",
      "_Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could\n",
      "to smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to\n",

      "Reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before\n",

      "indeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to\n",
      "check every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not\n",
      "talk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too\n",
      "engaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was\n",
      "forc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,\n",
      "against his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,\n",
      "that tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd\n",
      "in Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with\n",
      "each other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in\n",

      "of his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long\n",

      "Bosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The\n",
      "Passions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they\n",
      "cannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own\n",
      "Accuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King\n",
      "has not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other\n",
      "Foible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You\n",
      "take more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the\n",
      "Queen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in\n",
      "short, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her\n",
      "Eyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does\n",
      "not think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,\n",
      "to her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I\n",
      "tremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.\n",
      "Were you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other\n",
      "from all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out\n",
      "into a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself\n",
      "with Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully\n",

      "while so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the\n",
      "Discourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a\n",
      "Reverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,\n",
      "that her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd\n",
      "of every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand\n",
      "Things he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_\n",
      "Sandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the\n",
      "Queen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:\n",
      "These were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind\n",
      "to reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,\n",
      "Suspicions were converted into real Facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and\n",

      "jealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as\n",
      "ever; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by\n",
      "Nature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,\n",

      "tallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In\n",
      "short, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd\n",
      "to poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_\n",
      "strangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly\n",
      "given to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his\n",

      "regarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and\n",
      "yet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This\n",
      "little Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and\n",

      "to destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put\n",
      "into Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He\n",
      "could not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and\n",
      "take a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating\n",
      "with Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus\n",
      "attended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly\n",
      "incens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,\n",
      "a Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,\n",
      "expiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,\n",
      "and laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to\n",
      "denote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of\n",
      "Day. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of\n",
      "_Astarte's_ Female Favourites, then in waiting, call'd her up, and\n",
      "gave her to understand, that she must carry the Draught to _Astarte_\n",
      "that very Moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean Time, the Queen's Attendants, tho' it was Dead of Night,\n",

      "into his Hands a Billet from the Queen. At first he could not well\n",

      "Letter, with a trembling Hand, and a heavy Heart: Words can't\n",
      "express his Surprise, and the Agonies of Despair which he was in\n",

      "had defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a\n",
      "perfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate\n",
      "_Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the\n",
      "Lady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's\n",
      "sake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart\n",
      "would break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:\n",
      "Save, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_\n",
      "threw himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And\n",
      "as he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated\n",
      "with him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd\n",
      "with the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some\n",
      "Pity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,\n",
      "to the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of\n",
      "Nature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one\n",
      "who lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no\n",
      "other Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the\n",
      "jealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her\n",
      "Gallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this\n",
      "Moment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold\n",
      "of the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes\n",
      "up his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to\n",
      "plunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,\n",
      "warded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance\n",
      "towards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch\n",
      "it away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the\n",
      "_Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former\n",
      "made a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter\n",
      "parried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a\n",
      "Grass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more\n",
      "nimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided\n",
      "by his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at\n",
      "random. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and\n",
      "disarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was\n",
      "hotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by\n",
      "Dint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and\n",
      "tripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to\n",
      "his Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,\n",
      "fir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his\n",
      "Dagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor\n",
      "generously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being\n",
      "incens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.\n",
      "_Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the\n",
      "softest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,\n",
      "tho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and\n",
      "deliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man\n",
      "I ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure\n",
      "with me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!\n",
      "I could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had\n",
      "one of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you\n",
      "most unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you\n",
      "call'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to\n",
      "beat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be\n",
      "beat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God\n",
      "that he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more\n",
      "astonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,\n",
      "said to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that\n",
      "you tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my\n",
      "Turn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,\n",
      "he remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the\n",
      "Village: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd\n",
      "upon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They\n",
      "rode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.\n",
      "There she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the\n",
      "Description we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her\n",
      "dead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to\n",
      "_Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once\n",
      "more deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your\n",
      "Pardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand\n",
      "my Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most\n",
      "obedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight\n",
      "for one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool\n",
      "now, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure\n",
      "you, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled\n",
      "so fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,\n",
      "that the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd\n",
      "from King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the\n",
      "Haste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what\n",
      "should be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those\n",
      "_Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what\n",
      "to think of such a Termagant and a Coquet.\n",

      "\n",
      "No sooner was _Zadig_ arriv'd at the _Egyptian_ Village\n",
      "before-mention'd, but he found himself surrounded by a Croud. The\n",
      "People one and all cried out! See! See! there's the Man that ran\n",
      "away with the beauteous Lady _Missouf_, and murder'd _Cletofis_.\n",
      "Gentlemen, said he, God forbid that I should ever entertain a\n",
      "Thought of running away with the Lady you speak of: She is too much\n",
      "of a Coquet: And as to _Cletofis_, I did not murder him, but kill'd\n",
      "him in my own Defence. He endeavour'd all he could to take my Life\n",
      "away, because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on\n",
      "the beauteous _Missouf_, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a\n",
      "Stranger, who am fled hither for Shelter, and 'tis highly\n",
      "improbable, that upon my first Entrance into a Country, where I came\n",
      "for Safety and Protection, I should be guilty of two such enormous\n",
      "Crimes, as that of running away with another Man's Partner, and that\n",
      "of clandestinely murdering him on her Account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Egyptians_ at that Time were just and humane. The Populace, tis\n",
      "true, hurried _Zadig_ to the Town-Goal; but they took care in the\n",
      "first Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds, and afterwards\n",
      "examin'd the suppos'd Delinquents apart, in order to discover, if\n",
      "possible, the real Truth. They acquitted _Zadig_ of the Charge of\n",
      "wilful and premeditated Murder; but as he had taken a Subject's Life\n",
      "away, tho' in his own Defence, he was sentenc'd to be a Slave, as\n",
      "the Law directed. His two Beasts were sold in open Market, for the\n",
      "Service of the Hamlet; What Money he had was distributed amongst the\n",
      "Inhabitants; and he and his Attendant were expos'd in the\n",
      "Market-place to public Sale. An _Arabian_ Merchant, _Setoc_ by Name,\n",
      "purchas'd them both; but as the Valet, or Attendant, was a robust\n",
      "Man, and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master, he fetch'd\n",
      "the most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.\n",
      "_Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd\n",
      "them both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they\n",
      "accompanied their Master home. _Zadig_, as they were on the Road,\n",
      "comforted his Fellow-Slave, and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes\n",
      "with Patience: But, according to Custom, he made several Reflections\n",
      "on the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that\n",
      "my impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;\n",
      "every Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and\n",
      "unaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at\n",
      "_Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In\n",
      "the next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his\n",
      "Royal Consort's speaking a little too much in my Favour; and here I\n",
      "am a joint-Slave with thy self; because a turbulent Fellow of a\n",
      "Gallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on\n",
      "boldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have\n",
      "a happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these\n",
      "_Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and\n",
      "I, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This\n",
      "Master of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves\n",
      "with some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his\n",
      "Work. This was his Discourse to his Comrade; but his Mind was more\n",
      "attentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of _Babylon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two Days afterwards _Setoc_ set out with his two Slaves and his\n",
      "Camels, for _Arabia Deserta_. His Tribe liv'd near the Desert of\n",
      "_Horeb_. The Way was long and tedious. _Setoc_, during the Journey,\n",
      "paid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;\n",
      "because the former was the most able to load the Camels; and\n",
      "therefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his\n",
      "Favour. It so happen'd that one of the Camels died upon the Road:\n",
      "The Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown\n",
      "upon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.\n",
      "_Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching\n",
      "under their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason\n",
      "thereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The\n",
      "Merchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and\n",
      "look'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,\n",
      "perceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing\n",
      "him in several material Points, which were in some Measure,\n",
      "advantageous to him in his Way of Business: Such as, the specific\n",
      "Weight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an\n",
      "equal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best\n",
      "Ways and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit\n",
      "for Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a\n",
      "perfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man\n",
      "of the two. He us'd him courteously, and had no Room to repent of\n",
      "his Indulgence towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being got to their Journey's End, the first Step that _Setoc_ took\n",
      "was to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a _Jew_, who\n",
      "had borrow'd it in the Presence of two Witnesses; but both of them\n",
      "were dead; and as the _Jew_ was conscious he couldn't be cast for\n",
      "Want of Evidence, appropriated the Merchant's Money to his own Use,\n",
      "and thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an\n",
      "_Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy\n",
      "Situation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was\n",
      "it, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that\n",
      "ungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the\n",
      "Foot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said\n",
      "_Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd\n",
      "_Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,\n",
      "active Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the\n",
      "worst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly\n",
      "Fellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of\n",
      "your Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he\n",
      "summon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was\n",
      "sat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of\n",
      "Equity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the\n",
      "Defendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,\n",
      "and would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses\n",
      "ready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but\n",
      "there is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was\n",
      "deposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the\n",
      "Stone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will\n",
      "give, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence\n",
      "will order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the\n",
      "Court, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger\n",
      "to fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very\n",
      "reasonable, said the Judge. Do as you propose; and so call'd another\n",
      "Cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Court was ready to break up, Well! said the Judge to\n",
      "_Zadig_, is your Stone come yet? The _Jew_, with a Sneer, replied,\n",
      "your Excellence may wait here till this Time To-morrow, before the\n",
      "Stone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will\n",
      "require fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied\n",
      "_Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very\n",
      "material Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where\n",
      "the Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone\n",
      "the Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was\n",
      "soon oblig'd to acknowledge the Debt. The Judge order'd that the\n",
      "_Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,\n",
      "till he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver, which were\n",
      "soon paid accordingly, and the _Jew_ releas'd. The Slave _Zadig_,\n",
      "and this remarkable Stone-Witness, were in great Repute all over\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_Setoc_, transported with his good Success, of a Slave made _Zadig_\n",
      "his Favourite Companion and Confident; he found him as necessary in\n",
      "the Conduct of his Affairs, as the King of _Babylon_ had before done\n",
      "in the Administration of his Government; and lucky it was for\n",
      "_Zadig_ that _Setoc_ had no Wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "He discover'd, that his Master was in his Temper benevolent,\n",
      "strictly honest, and a Man of good natural Parts. _Zadig_ was very\n",
      "much concern'd, that One of so much Sense should pay divine\n",
      "Adoration to a whole Host of created, tho' Celestial Beings, that is\n",
      "to say, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, according to the antient Custom of\n",
      "the _Arabians_. He talk'd, at first, to his Master, with great\n",
      "Precaution on so important a Topick. But at last told him, in direct\n",
      "Terms, that they were created Bodies, as others, tho' of less\n",
      "Lustre, and that there was no more Adoration due to them, than to a\n",
      "Stock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom\n",
      "we are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;\n",
      "they regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite\n",
      "Distance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore\n",
      "them. You are more indebted, said _Zadig_, to the Waters of the Red\n",
      "Sea, which transport so many valuable Commodities into the _Indies_.\n",
      "Why, pray, may not they be deem'd as antient as the Stars? And if\n",
      "you are so fond of paying your Adoration on Account of their vast\n",
      "Distance; why don't you adore the Land of the _Gangarides_, which\n",
      "lies in the utmost Extremities of the Earth. No, said _Setoc_, there\n",
      "is something so surprisingly more brilliant in the Stars than what\n",
      "you speak of; that a Man must adore them whether he will or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Close of the Evening, _Zadig_ planted a long Range of Candles\n",
      "in the Front of his Tent, where _Setoc_ and he were to sup that\n",
      "Night: And as soon as he perceiv'd his Patron to be at the Door, he\n",
      "fell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax-Lights. O ye everlasting,\n",
      "ever-shining Luminaries, be always propitious to your Votary, said\n",
      "_Zadig_. Having repeated these Words so loud as _Setoc_ might hear\n",
      "them, he sat down to Table, without taking the least Notice of\n",
      "_Setoc_. What! said _Setoc_, somewhat startled at his Conduct, art\n",
      "thou at thy Prayers before Supper? I act just as inconsistently,\n",
      "Sir, as you do; I worship these Candles; without reflecting on their\n",
      "Makers, or yourself, who are my most beneficent Patron.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Setoc_ took the Hint, and was conscious of the Reproof that was\n",
      "conceal'd so genteely under a Vail. The superior Wisdom of his Slave\n",
      "enlightned his Mind; and from that Hour he was less lavish than ever\n",
      "he had been, of his Incense to those created Beings, and for the\n",
      "future, paid his Adoration to the eternal God who made them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that Time there was a most hideous Custom in high Repute all over\n",
      "_Arabia_, which came originally from _Scythia_; but having met with\n",
      "the Sanction of the bigotted Brachmans, threatn'd to spread its\n",
      "Infection all over the _East_. When a married Man happen'd to die,\n",
      "if his dearly beloved Widow ever expected to be esteem'd a Saint,\n",
      "she must throw herself headlong upon her Husband's Funeral-Pile.\n",
      "This was look'd upon as a solemn Festival, and was call'd the\n",
      "Widow's Sacrifice. That Tribe which could boast of the greatest\n",
      "Number of burnt-Widows, was look'd upon as the most meritorious. An\n",
      "_Arabian_, who was of the Tribe of _Setoc_, happen'd just at that\n",
      "Juncture, to be dead, and his Widow (_Almona_ by Name) who was a\n",
      "noted Devotee, publish'd the Day, nay, the Hour, that she propos'd\n",
      "to throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's\n",
      "Funeral Pile, and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets.\n",
      "_Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,\n",
      "and how directly repugnant to human Nature; by permitting young\n",
      "Widows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they\n",
      "might be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new\n",
      "Subjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal\n",
      "Indulgence. And, by arguing seriously with _Setoc_ for some Time, he\n",
      "forc'd from him at last, an ingenuous Confession, that the barbarous\n",
      "Custom then subsisting, ought, if possible, to be abolish'd. 'Tis\n",
      "now, replied _Setoc_, above a thousand Years since the Widows of\n",
      "_Arabia_ have been indulg'd with this Privilege of dying with their\n",
      "Husbands; and how shall any one dare to abrogate a Law that has been\n",
      "establish'd Time out of Mind? Is there any Thing more inviolable\n",
      "than even an antient Error? But, replied _Zadig_, Reason is of more\n",
      "antient Date than the Custom you plead for. Do you communicate these\n",
      "Sentiments to the Sovereigns of your Tribes, and in the mean while\n",
      "I'll go, and sound the Widow's Inclinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly he paid her a Visit, and having insinuated himself into\n",
      "her Favour, by a few Compliments on her Beauty, after urging what a\n",
      "pity it was, that a young Widow, Mistress of so many Charms, should\n",
      "make away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes\n",
      "with a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for\n",
      "her heroic Constancy and Courage. I perceive, Madam, said he, you\n",
      "was excessively fond of your deceased Spouse. Not I truly, reply'd\n",
      "the young _Arabian_ Devotee. He was a Brute, infected with a\n",
      "groundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.\n",
      "But, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our\n",
      "Custom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in\n",
      "being burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock\n",

      "swill'd down whole Bumpers, told a Hundred merry Tales, and swore a\n",
      "thousand Times over, that he was the happiest Creature upon God's\n",
      "Earth; persuading _Zadig_ to be as merry, and thoughtless as\n",

      "Suburbs of _Babylon_, I was inform'd, that not only the Queen, but\n",

      "courteous Manner, if he might have the Honour to assist her in her\n",
      "Researches. Have a care, said she. What we are hunting after, Sir,\n",
      "is an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man.\n",
      "'Tis somewhat surprizing, said _Zadig_. May I be so bold, pray, as\n",
      "to ask you what you are in Pursuit after, that shuns the Touch of\n",
      "any Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex. 'Tis, Sir, said she, the\n",
      "_Basilisk_: A _Basilisk_, Madam, said he! And pray, if you will be\n",
      "so good as to inform me, with what View, are you searching after a\n",
      "Creature so very difficult to be met with? 'Tis, Sir, said she, for\n",
      "our Lord and Master _Ogul_, whose Castle, you see, situate on the\n",
      "River-side, at the Bottom of the Meadow. We are all his Vassals.\n",
      "_Ogul_, you must know, is in a very bad State of Health, and his\n",
      "first Physician has order'd him, as a Specific, to eat a _Basilisk_,\n",
      "boil'd in Rose water: And as that Animal is very hard to be catch'd,\n",
      "and will suffer nothing to approach it, but one of our Sex, our\n",
      "dying Sovereign _Ogul_ has promis'd to honour her, that shall be so\n",
      "happy as to catch it for him, so far as to make her his Consort. The\n",
      "Case, being thus circumstantiated, Sir, I hope you will not\n",
      "interrupt me any longer, lest my Rivals here in the Field should\n",
      "happen to circumvent me.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ withdrew, and left the _Syrian_ Ladies in Quest of their\n",
      "imaginary Booty, in order to pursue his intended Journey. But as he\n",
      "came to the Banks of a Rivulet, at the remotest part of the Meadow,\n",
      "he perceiv'd another young Lady, reclin'd on the Grass, and entirely\n",
      "disengag'd. Her Stature seem'd majestic, but her Face was cover'd\n",
      "with a Vail; and her Eyes were fixt, as one at her Looking-glass, on\n",
      "the River. Every now and then a Sigh burst out, as if her Heart were\n",
      "breaking. In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod, with which she\n",
      "was tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand, that lay between\n",
      "the flow'ry Bank she sat on, and the purling Current. _Zadig's_\n",
      "Curiosity induc'd him, unperceiv'd, to observe her Operations at\n",
      "some Distance. But approaching nearer, and perceiving very\n",
      "distinctly the first Character to be an _Z_. the next an _A_. and\n",
      "the third a _D_. he started; but when he saw the additional Capitals\n",
      "of _I_ and _G_. his Astonishment was too great for Words to express.\n",
      "He stood for some Time perfectly thunder-struck, and as motionless\n",
      "as a Statue; At last, in a soft, faultring Tone, he broke Silence: O\n",
      "generous Lady, said he, forgive a Stranger, one overwhelm'd with\n",
      "Sorrows like yourself, if he asks you, by what amazing Accident he\n",
      "finds the Name of _Zadig_ delineated by so angelick a Hand. Thus\n",
      "unexpectedly interrupted, and at the Sound of those Words, she\n",
      "turn'd her Head; and with a trembling Hand, lifting up her Vail, she\n",
      "espy'd _Zadig_ himself. Upon which, she shriek'd; and as her Heart\n",
      "was flutter'd between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize,\n",
      "she fainted away, and gently dropp'd into his Arms. 'Twas, it seems\n",
      "_Astarte_ her self; 'twas the Queen of _Babylon_; 'twas the very\n",
      "_Goddess_ whom _Zadig_ ador'd; 'twas, in short, the very identical\n",
      "Lady, whose hard Fate he had so long deplor'd; and for whose sake he\n",
      "had felt so many agonizing Pains. For a few Minutes he stood\n",
      "speechless, and depriv'd, as it were, of all his senses, whilst his\n",
      "Eyes were fixt on his _Astarte_, who began to revive; and cast a\n",
      "wishful Glance at him, attended with some Confusion. O ye immortal\n",
      "Powers, cried he, who preside over the Destiny of us frail Mortals!\n",
      "Ye have restor'd me my _Astarte_; but alas! at what a Conjuncture,\n",
      "in what a Place, and in what a State and Condition do I view her? He\n",
      "threw himself prostrate on the Ground, and kiss'd the Dust of her\n",
      "Feet. The Queen of _Babylon_ rais'd him up, and oblig'd him to sit\n",
      "by her on the flow'ry Bank whereon she was repos'd. Every now and\n",
      "then she wip'd her Eyes, as the Tears trickl'd down afresh her\n",
      "lovely Cheeks. Twenty times she endeavour'd to renew her Discourse;\n",
      "but was interrupted by her Sighs; she ask'd him over and over to\n",
      "relate to her the Hardships he had ran thro' since their parting,\n",
      "and by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow; but\n",
      "prevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer, by\n",
      "repeating Question upon Question. At last, she gave him a particular\n",
      "Detail of her own Misfortunes, and again requested to know his. Both\n",
      "of them, in short, having, in some Measure, appeas'd the Tumult of\n",
      "their Souls; _Zadig_, in a few Words, inform'd her of the Motives\n",
      "that brought him thither.\n",
      "\n",
      "But tell me, O unfortunate, tho' ever-venerable Queen, how I came to\n",
      "find you out, reclining on this verdant Bank, dress'd in this\n",
      "servile Habit, accompanied by other Female Slaves, who, I find, have\n",
      "been all Day long in Quest after a _Basilisk_, which, as I\n",
      "understand, is by Order of a celebrated Physician, to be dissolv'd\n",
      "in Rose-water, as a specific Medicine for his dying Patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst they busy in their fruitless Search, said the beauteous\n",
      "_Astarte_, I'll tell you the whole Series of Sorrows which I have\n",
      "undergone since last we parted; and since Heav'n has thus\n",
      "unexpectedly blest my Eyes once more with the Sight of my dear\n",
      "_Zadig_, I'll no longer exclaim against my impropitious Stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not insensible, that the jealous King my Spouse, was\n",
      "disgusted to find you the most amiable of all Mortals, and that for\n",
      "no other Reason he determin'd to strangle you, and poison me. You\n",
      "know very well too, that indulgent Heav'n inspir'd, as it were, my\n",
      "little Dwarf, with artful Means to give me timely Notice of the rash\n",
      "Resolutions of the King, my cruel Husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and\n",
      "to fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead\n",
      "of Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me\n",
      "directly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who\n",
      "was his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that\n",
      "stands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,\n",
      "touches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or\n",
      "rather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and\n",
      "furnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and\n",
      "loyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of\n",
      "Day into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,\n",
      "black Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.\n",
      "Whilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus\n",
      "employ'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with\n",
      "the silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us\n",
      "were fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the\n",
      "more artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us\n",
      "both, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that\n",
      "Villain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;\n",
      "and your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to\n",
      "_Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never\n",
      "expos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in\n",
      "the Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they\n",
      "had no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as\n",
      "it had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all\n",
      "Probability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on\n",
      "the Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very\n",
      "disconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to\n",
      "themselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her\n",
      "Complaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their\n",
      "gross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but\n",
      "after he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was\n",
      "extremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I\n",
      "have been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language\n",
      "signifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as\n",
      "much Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In\n",
      "short, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple\n",
      "in publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far\n",
      "in her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of\n",
      "a perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in\n",
      "her Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She\n",
      "insisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a\n",
      "Saraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so\n",
      "preposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing\n",
      "would serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand\n",
      "Master of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took\n",
      "the Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,\n",
      "however, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his\n",
      "Place for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of\n",
      "the Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and\n",
      "made her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and\n",
      "Confidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of\n",
      "_Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.\n",
      "The King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he\n",
      "would have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd\n",
      "all his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.\n",
      "He came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I\n",
      "saw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was\n",
      "enclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings\n",
      "on his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but\n",
      "hollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of\n",
      "Kings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant\n",
      "o'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent\n",
      "Wife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._\n",
      "_Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he\n",
      "ador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle\n",
      "that I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new\n",
      "Spouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In\n",
      "short, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which\n",
      "seem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His\n",
      "Subjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.\n",
      "_Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,\n",
      "became the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was\n",
      "taken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up\n",
      "at the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to\n",
      "_Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to\n",
      "_Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine\n",
      "Broils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third\n",
      "Party, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with\n",
      "his fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was\n",
      "so closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his\n",
      "Retreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for\n",
      "my own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and\n",
      "taken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the\n",
      "Presence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_\n",
      "stood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the\n",
      "Prince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but\n",
      "then, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd\n",
      "me to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that\n",
      "as soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,\n",
      "which would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would\n",
      "honour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was\n",
      "under, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations\n",
      "to _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of\n",
      "_Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a\n",
      "_Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of\n",
      "my high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that\n",
      "Heav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of\n",
      "Majesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an\n",
      "angry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those\n",
      "audacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I\n",
      "talk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile\n",
      "Domestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me\n",
      "one Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was\n",
      "very impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very\n",
      "pretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,\n",
      "and put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one\n",
      "of his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which\n",
      "was somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a\n",
      "little Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive\n",
      "him, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,\n",
      "I would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like\n",
      "me, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;\n",
      "and then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man\n",
      "would part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her\n",
      "gilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of\n",
      "the Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly\n",
      "devoted to her _Zadig_!\n",
      "\n",
      "At these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and\n",
      "bath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the\n",
      "most courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her\n",
      "Narration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the\n",
      "Tyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a\n",
      "Slave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in\n",
      "_Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and\n",
      "Place, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute\n",
      "Circumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in\n",
      "her Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in\n",
      "_Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.\n",
      "Beauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier\n",
      "Disposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young\n",
      "Prince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out\n",
      "some Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady\n",
      "Regent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly\n",
      "Assistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,\n",
      "(cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took\n",
      "care to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an\n",
      "old _Egyptian_ Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious\n",
      "Free-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was\n",
      "strolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to\n",
      "yonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He\n",
      "purchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I\n",
      "was. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good\n",
      "Eating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty\n",
      "sent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his\n",
      "unruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every\n",
      "Moment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so\n",
      "unmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can\n",
      "persuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at\n",
      "him, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has\n",
      "intimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing\n",
      "will restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon\n",
      "the grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,\n",
      "whoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,\n",
      "for him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I\n",
      "have others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a\n",
      "less Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since\n",
      "I have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth\n",
      "the virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;\n",
      "and reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in\n",
      "Distress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over\n",
      "all the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy\n",
      "and Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended\n",
      "on _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was\n",
      "fruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be\n",
      "introduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address\n",
      "was to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from\n",
      "Heaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a\n",
      "Physician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of\n",
      "the dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_\n",
      "with me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour\n",
      "of your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I\n",
      "request, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has\n",
      "been in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to\n",
      "be your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most\n",
      "illustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly\n",
      "discharg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,\n",
      "according to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear\n",
      "every Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new\n",
      "Patient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very\n",
      "affectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to\n",
      "each other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it\n",
      "is written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable\n",
      "_Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of\n",
      "Affection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure\n",
      "Dictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a\n",
      "deeper Impression on hers, than she thought proper to discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;\n",
      "my _Basilisk_, Sir, as others are, is not to be drest or eaten; but\n",
      "all its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;\n",
      "I have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,\n",
      "full-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must\n",
      "kick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour\n",
      "together, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can. This\n",
      "Medicine must be repeated every Morning, and I'll attend the\n",
      "Operation: Upon your due Observance of the Regimen I shall put you\n",
      "under, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest\n",
      "Endeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an\n",
      "Adept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was\n",
      "ready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with\n",

      "broke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his\n",
      "Antagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,\n",

      "incens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_\n",
      "sprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the\n",
      "two Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!\n",
      "where they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for\n",
      "both were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their\n",
      "Helmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew\n",
      "about in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times\n",
      "repeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their\n",
      "Swords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the\n",
      "Right, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they\n",
      "retreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd\n",
      "again; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two\n",
      "Serpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions\n",
      "fighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every\n",
      "Blow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment\n",
      "or two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,\n",
      "threw him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried\n",
      "out, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd\n",
      "to be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.\n",
      "The two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the\n",
      "others had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.\n",
      "Several Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them\n",
      "some proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the\n",
      "Queen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy\n",
      "Occasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants\n",
      "to rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the\n",
      "Victor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in\n",
      "order to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the\n",
      "Queen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge\n",
      "contiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He\n",
      "got up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,\n",
      "and substituted his green One in its Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly\n",
      "undaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was\n",
      "the mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he\n",
      "gain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was\n",
      "awake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,\n",
      "return'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of\n",
      "_Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the\n",
      "Amphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could\n",
      "find nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against\n",
      "his Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear\n",
      "in: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made\n",
      "his personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace\n",
      "that were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he\n",
      "took, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks\n",
      "of Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was\n",
      "never sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite\n",
      "out of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,\n",
      "with his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,\n",
      "or how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to\n",
      "have a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour\n",
      "again which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the\n",
      "Engagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:\n",
      "Thus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so\n",
      "on the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and\n",
      "Resentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks\n",
      "of the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star\n",
      "had shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes\n",
      "were irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments\n",
      "from his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd\n",
      "an utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white\n",
      "Armour. See! said he, the fatal Consequence of being a Sluggard! Had\n",
      "I been more vigilant, I had been King of _Babylon_; but what is\n",
      "more, I had been happy in the Embraces of my dearest _Astarte_. All\n",
      "the Knowledge of Books or Mankind; all the personal Valour that I\n",
      "can boast of, has only prov'd an Aggravation of my Sorrows. He\n",
      "carried the Point so far at last, as to murmur at the unequal\n",
      "Dispensations of Divine Providence; and was tempted to believe, that\n",
      "all Occurrences were govern'd by a malignant Destiny, which never\n",
      "fail'd to oppress the Virtuous, and always crown'd the Actions of\n",
      "such Villains as the green Knight, with uncommon Success. In one of\n",
      "his frantick Fits, he put on the green Armour, that had created him\n",
      "such a World of Disgrace. A Merchant happening to pass by, he sold\n",
      "it to him for a Trifle, and took in Exchange nothing more than a\n",
      "Mantle, and a Cap. In this Disguise, he took a solitary Walk along\n",
      "the Banks of the _Euphrates_, every Minute reflecting in his Mind on\n",

      "As _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey\n",
      "and venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a\n",
      "little Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in\n",
      "his Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the\n",
      "Compliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a\n",
      "Stranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the\n",
      "Treatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the\n",
      "Hermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put\n",
      "the Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect\n",
      "Master of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.\n",
      "This rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the\n",
      "good Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If\n",
      "you'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I\n",
      "may be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments\n",
      "of Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret\n",
      "Regard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He\n",
      "found, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person\n",
      "he had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,\n",
      "Morality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and\n",
      "Vice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that\n",
      "_Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd\n",
      "earnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.\n",
      "That Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to\n",
      "me by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,\n",
      "let me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both\n",
      "pursu'd their Journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The\n",
      "Hermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young\n",
      "Comrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,\n",
      "let them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he\n",
      "conducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every\n",
      "rich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper\n",
      "afterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they\n",
      "were taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd\n",
      "with as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.\n",
      "When they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden\n",
      "Bason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to\n",
      "go to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;\n",
      "and the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for\n",
      "their mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were\n",
      "dismiss'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the\n",
      "Road, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat\n",
      "too haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out\n",
      "of his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's\n",
      "Garment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon\n",
      "saw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off\n",
      "the Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;\n",
      "but was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the\n",

      "Companion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,\n",
      "shabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,\n",
      "and carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few\n",
      "musty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit\n",
      "seem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At\n",
      "last, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old\n",
      "Valet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they\n",
      "had been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that\n",
      "he fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of\n",
      "Gold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his\n",
      "Gratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I\n",
      "would willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The\n",

      "Reception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this\n",
      "Golden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser\n",
      "started, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so\n",
      "valuable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of\n",
      "his Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.\n",
      "Father, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to\n",

      "Profusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who\n",
      "treated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that\n",
      "Grandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than\n",
      "to gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the\n",
      "Furniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and\n",
      "the Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be\n",
      "surpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and\n",
      "couldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater\n",
      "Wisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an\n",
      "Ascendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he\n",
      "couldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very\n",
      "commodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,\n",
      "and yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had\n",
      "retir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his\n",
      "Mind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the\n",
      "Reception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without\n",
      "Ostentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a\n",
      "Time, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious\n",
      "Apartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet\n",
      "elegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the\n",
      "late Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the\n",
      "Queen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the\n",
      "Lists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a\n",
      "King of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at\n",
      "this unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his\n",
      "Misfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this\n",
      "World took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest\n",
      "Patriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence\n",
      "are often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for\n",
      "casting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare\n",
      "Inspection of the minutest Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said\n",
      "_Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,\n",
      "they are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,\n",
      "'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing\n",
      "without them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then\n",
      "there is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is\n",
      "dangerous, yet All are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and\n",
      "the Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,\n",
      "said he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he\n",
      "receives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,\n",
      "proceed from a superior Cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such\n",
      "vile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the\n",
      "proper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry\n",
      "way agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,\n",
      "thanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers\n",
      "to his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to\n",
      "defray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect\n",
      "and Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.\n",
      "The Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd\n",
      "to set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very\n",
      "affectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more\n",
      "than common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the\n",
      "Hermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in\n",
      "Praise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old\n",
      "Hermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but\n",
      "as all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my\n",
      "Respect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words\n",
      "out of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set\n",
      "the Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd\n",
      "out, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of\n",
      "such a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by\n",
      "a superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got\n",
      "at a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,\n",
      "turn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,\n",
      "our fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense\n",
      "Treasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his\n",
      "Beneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.\n",
      "_Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their\n",
      "last Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and\n",
      "well-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of\n",
      "Age. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She\n",
      "entertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House\n",
      "afforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an\n",
      "adjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days\n",
      "before, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When\n",
      "they were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the\n",
      "Hermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her\n",
      "last Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair\n",
      "of his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went\n",
      "the little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;\n",
      "but was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of\n",
      "Villains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to\n",
      "view my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd\n",
      "but one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who\n",
      "told you so, you barbarous Wretch, said _Zadig_? And when did you\n",
      "read that inhuman Event in your _Black-Book_ of _Fate_? Who gave you\n",
      "Permission pray, to drown so innocent a Youth, that had never\n",
      "disoblig'd you?\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had our young _Babylonian_ ceas'd his severe Reflections,\n",
      "but he perceiv'd that the old Hermit's long Beard grew shorter and\n",
      "shorter; that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up, and that his\n",
      "Cheeks glow'd with a Rose-coloured Red, as if he had been in the\n",
      "Bloom of Fifteen. His Mantle was vanish'd at once; and on his\n",
      "Shoulders, which were before cover'd, appear'd four angelic Wings,\n",
      "each refulgent as the Sun. O thou Messenger of Heaven! O thou\n",
      "angelic Form! cry'd _Zadig_, and fell prostrate at his Feet; thou\n",
      "art descended from the Empireum, I find, to instruct such a poor\n",
      "frail Mortal as I am, how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate.\n",
      "Mankind in general, said the Angel _Jesrad_, judge of the Whole, by\n",
      "only viewing the hither Link of the Chain. Thou, of all the human\n",
      "Race, wast the only Man that deserv'd to have thy Mind enlighten'd.\n",
      "_Zadig_, begg'd Leave to speak. I am somewhat diffident of myself,\n",
      "'tis true; but may I presume, Sir, to beg the Solution of one\n",
      "Scruple? Would it not have been better to have chastiz'd the Lad,\n",
      "and by that Means reform'd him, than to have cut him off thus\n",
      "unprepar'd in a Moment. _Jesrad_, replied, had he been virtuous, and\n",
      "had he liv'd, 'twas his _Fate_ not only to be murder'd himself, but\n",
      "his Wife, whom he would afterwards have married, and the little\n",
      "Infant, that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection.\n",
      "Is it necessary then, venerable Guide, that there should be\n",
      "Wickedness and Misfortunes in the World, and that those Misfortunes\n",
      "should fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous? The Wicked,\n",
      "replied _Jesrad_, are always unhappy. Misfortunes are intended only\n",
      "as a Touch-stone, to try a small Number of the Just, who are thinly\n",
      "scatter'd about this terrestrial Globe: Besides, there is no Evil\n",
      "under the Sun, but some Good proceeds from it: But, said _Zadig_,\n",
      "Suppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in\n",
      "Nature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be\n",
      "another World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that\n",
      "other Order, which would be perfect, must of Necessity be the\n",
      "everlasting Residence of the supreme Being, whom no Evil can\n",
      "approach. That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number\n",
      "of Worlds, and no two of them alike. This vast Variety is an\n",
      "Attribute of his Omnipotence. There are not two Leaves on the Trees\n",
      "throughout the Universe, nor any two Globes of Light amongst the\n",
      "Myriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven, which are\n",
      "perfectly alike. And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth,\n",
      "whereof you are a Native, must exist in the Place, and at the Time\n",
      "appointed, according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends\n",
      "the Whole. Mankind imagine, that the Lad, whom I plung'd into the\n",
      "River, was drown'd by _Chance_; and that our generous Benefactor's\n",
      "House was reduc'd to Ashes by the same _Chance_; but know, there is\n",
      "no such Thing as _Chance_, all Misfortunes are intended, either as\n",
      "severe Trials, Judgments, or Rewards; and are the Result of\n",

      "Sound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue, the Angel took his\n",
      "Flight towards the tenth Sphere. _Zadig_ sunk down upon his Knees,\n",
      "and acknowledg'd an over-ruling Providence with all the Marks of the\n",

      "_Zadig_, as one beside himself, and perfectly thunder-struck, beat\n",
      "his March at random. He entred, however, into the City of _Babylon_,\n",
      "on that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd\n",
      "in the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious\n",
      "Outer-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the Ænigmas, and give\n",
      "the wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand\n",
      "Magus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,\n",
      "except the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made\n",
      "his Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about\n",
      "him: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were\n",
      "lavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their\n",
      "Sovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a\n",
      "deep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud\n",
      "Acclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had\n",
      "heard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and\n",
      "Despair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she\n",
      "couldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his\n",
      "Accoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the\n",
      "snow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran\n",
      "thro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the\n",
      "same Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into\n",
      "the Assembly-Room except the Knights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,\n",
      "tho' another appears clad in my Armour; but in the mean Time, before\n",
      "I can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into\n",
      "Court, in order to give my Solutions to such Ænigmas as shall be\n",
      "propos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a\n",
      "Man of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted\n",
      "on their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the\n",
      "Affirmative, without the least Opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the\n",
      "longest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and\n",
      "the most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least\n",
      "valu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can\n",
      "possibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute\n",
      "soever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,\n",
      "however Great?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man\n",
      "of his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;\n",
      "'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the\n",
      "Circus. One said, the Solution of the Ænigma propos'd was _Fortune_;\n",
      "others said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_\n",
      "pronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since\n",
      "'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is\n",
      "Time always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so\n",
      "slowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as\n",
      "Time to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's\n",
      "Extent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in\n",
      "part. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of\n",
      "it when 'tis past. Nothing can possibly be done without it; it\n",
      "buries in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to\n",
      "Posterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The\n",
      "Assembly agreed unanimously that _Zadig_ was in the Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Question that was started, was, What is the Thing we\n",
      "receive, without being ever thankful for it; which we enjoy, without\n",
      "knowing how we came by it; which we give away to others, without\n",
      "knowing where 'tis to be found; and which we lose, without being any\n",
      "ways conscious of our Misfortune?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each pass'd his Verdict. _Zadig_ was the only Person that concluded\n",
      "it was LIFE. He solv'd every Ænigma propos'd, with equal Facility.\n",
      "_Itobad_, when he heard the Explications, always said that nothing\n",
      "in the World was more easy, than to solve such obvious Questions;\n",
      "and that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least\n",
      "Hesitation, were he inclin'd to trouble his Head about such Trifles.\n",
      "Other Questions were propos'd in regard to Justice, the sovereign\n",
      "Good, and the Art of Government. _Zadig's_ Answers still carried the\n",
      "greatest Weight. What Pity 'tis, said some who were present, that\n",
      "one of so comprehensive a Genius, should make such a scurvy\n",
      "Cavalier?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most illustrious Grandees, said _Zadig_, I was the Person that had\n",
      "the Honour of being Victor at your Circus; the white Armour, most\n",
      "puissant Lords, was mine. That awkward Warrior there, Lord _Itobad_,\n",
      "dress'd himself in it whilst I was asleep. He imagin'd, it is plain,\n",
      "that it would do him more Honour than his own Green one. Unaccoutred\n",
      "as I am, I am ready, before this august Assembly, to give them\n",
      "incontestable Proof of my superior Skill; to engage with the Usurper\n",
      "of the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet; and\n",
      "to testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired\n",
      "_Hottam_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Itobad_ accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success\n",
      "imaginable. He did not doubt, but being properly accoutred with his\n",
      "Helmet, his Cuirass, and his Bracelets, he should be able to hue\n",
      "down an Antagonist, in his Mantle and Cap, and nothing to skreen him\n",
      "from his Resentment, but a single Sabre. _Zadig_ drew his Sword, and\n",
      "saluted the Queen with it, who view'd him with Transport mix'd with\n",
      "Fear. _Itobad_ drew his, but paid his Compliments to Nobody. He\n",
      "approach'd _Zadig_, as one, whom he imagin'd incapable of making any\n",
      "considerable Resistance. He concluded, 'twas in his Power to cut\n",
      "_Zadig_ into Atoms. _Zadig_, however, knew how to parry the Blow, by\n",
      "dexterously receiving it upon his _Fort_ (as the Swords-men call it)\n",
      "by which Means _Itobad's_ Sword was snapt in two. With that _Zadig_\n",
      "in an Instant clos'd his Adversary, and by his superior Strength, as\n",
      "well as Skill, laid him sprawling on his Back. Then holding the\n",
      "Point of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass, Submit to be\n",
      "stripp'd of your borrow'd Plumes, or you are a dead Man this Moment.\n",
      "_Itobad_, always surpriz'd, that any Disappointment should attend a\n",
      "Man of such exalted Merit as himself, very tamely permitted _Zadig_\n",
      "to disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet, his superb Cuirass,\n",
      "his rich Bracelets, his brilliant Cuisses, or Armour for his Thighs,\n",
      "and other Martial Accoutrements. When _Zadig_ had equipp'd himself\n",
      "_Cap-a-pee_, in his now recover'd Armour, he flew to _Astarte_, and\n",
      "threw himself prostrate at her Feet. _Cador_ prov'd, without any\n",
      "great Difficulty, that the White Armour was _Zadig's_ Property. He\n",
      "was thereupon acknowledg'd King of _Babylon_, by the unanimous\n",

      "Approbation of _Astarte_, who after such a long Series of\n",
      "Misfortunes, now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling _Zadig_\n",
      "thought worthy, in the Opinion of the whole World, to be the Partner\n",
      "of her royal Bed. _Itobad_ withdrew, and contented himself with\n",
      "being call'd _my Lord_ within the narrow Compass of his own\n",
      "Domesticks. _Zadig_, in short, was elected King, and was as happy as\n",
      "any Mortal could be.\n",

      "In the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of\n",
      "_Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with\n",
      "an uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on\n",
      "him an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,\n",
      "he knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways\n",
      "self-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of\n",
      "Reason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with\n",
      "an Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that\n",
      "notwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,\n",
      "never so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle\n",
      "Tattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for\n",
      "those rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those\n",
      "insipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,\n",
      "which was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned\n",
      "from the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder\n",
      "full blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty\n",
      "Tempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of\n",
      "the Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He\n",
      "was of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of\n",
      "obliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise\n",
      "Maxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the\n",
      "Dogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite\n",
      "you._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond\n",
      "of no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As\n",
      "he was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient\n",
      "_Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural\n",
      "Philosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of\n",
      "Metaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he\n",
      "knew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that\n",
      "the Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant\n",
      "to the new Philosophy of the Age he liv'd in; and that the Sun was\n",
      "situated in the Center of the Earth; And when the Chief Magi told\n",
      "him, with an imperious Air, that he maintain'd erroneous Principles;\n",
      "and that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which\n",
      "he liv'd, to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis, and\n",
      "that the Year consisted of twelve Months, he knew how to sit still\n",
      "and quiet, without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or\n",
      "Contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As _Zadig_ was immensely rich, and had consequently Friends without\n",
      "Number; and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution, and\n",
      "remarkably handsome; as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of\n",
      "ready and inoffensive Wit: And, in a Word, as his Heart was\n",
      "perfectly sincere and open, he imagin'd himself, in some Measure,\n",
      "qualified to be perfectly happy. For which Purpose he determin'd to\n",
      "marry a gay young Lady (one _Semira_ by name) whose Beauty, Birth\n",
      "and Fortune, render'd her the most desirable Person in all\n",
      "_Babylon_. He had a sincere Affection for her, grounded on Honour,\n",
      "and _Semira_ conceiv'd as tender a Passion for him. They were just\n",
      "upon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of\n",
      "Matrimony, when, as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards\n",
      "one of the Gates of _Babylon_, under the Shade of a Row of\n",
      "Palm-trees, that grew on the Banks of the River _Euphrates_, they\n",
      "were beset by a Band of Ruffians, arm'd with Sabres, Bows and\n",
      "Arrows. They were the Guards, it seems, of young _Orcan_ (Nephew of\n",
      "a certain Minister of State) whom the Parasites, kept by his Uncle,\n",
      "had buoy'd up with a Permission to do, with Impunity, whatever he\n",
      "thought proper. This young Rival, tho' he had none of those internal\n",
      "Qualities to boast of that _Zadig_ had, yet he imagin'd himself a\n",
      "Man of more Power; and for that Reason, was perfectly outrageous to\n",
      "see the other preferr'd before him. This Fit of Jealousy, the Result\n",
      "of mere Vanity, prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love\n",
      "with the fair _Semira_; and fir'd with that amorous Notion, he was\n",
      "determin'd to take her away from _Zadig_, by Dint of Arms. The\n",
      "Ravishers rush'd rudely upon her, and in the Transport of their\n",
      "Rage, drew the Blood of a Beauty, the Sight of whose Charms would\n",
      "have soften'd the very Tigers of Mount _Imaüs_. The injur'd Lady\n",
      "rent the very Heavens with her Exclamations. Where's my dear\n",
      "Husband, she cried? They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man\n",
      "whom I adore. She never reflected on the Danger to which she was\n",
      "expos'd; her sole Concern was for her beloved _Zadig_. At the same\n",
      "Time, he defended her, like a Lover, and a Man of Integrity and\n",
      "Courage. With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants, he put\n",
      "those Sons of Violence to Flight, and conducted _Semira_, bloody as\n",
      "she was, and in fainting Fits, to her own House. No sooner was she\n",
      "come to her self, but she fix'd her lovely Eyes on her Dear\n",
      "Deliverer. O _Zadig_, said she, I love thee as affectionately, as if\n",
      "I were actually thy Bride: I love thee, as the Man, to whom I owe my\n",
      "Life, and what is dearer to me, the Preservation of my Honour. No\n",
      "Heart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of _Semira_. Never\n",
      "did the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds;\n",
      "never did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of\n",
      "Love and Gratitude for his signal Service; never, in short, did the\n",
      "most affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the\n",
      "fondest Husband. Her Wounds, however, were but very superficial, and\n",
      "she was soon recover'd. _Zadig_ receiv'd a Wound that was much more\n",
      "dangerous: An unlucky Arrow had graz'd one of his Eyes, and the\n",
      "Orifice was deep. _Semira_ was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods\n",
      "that they might restore her _Zadig_. Her Eyes were Night and Day\n",
      "overwhelm'd with Tears. She waited with Impatience for the happy\n",
      "Moment, when those of _Zadig_ might dart their Fires upon her; but\n",
      "alas! the wounded Eye grew so inflam'd and swell'd, that she was\n",
      "terrified to the last Degree. She sent as far as _Memphis_ for\n",
      "_Hermes_, the celebrated Physician there, who instantly attended his\n",
      "new Patient with a numerous Retinue. Upon his first Visit, he\n",
      "peremptorily declared that _Zadig_ would lose his Eye; and foretold\n",
      "not only the Day, but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would\n",
      "befal him. Had it been, said that Great Man, his right Eye, I could\n",
      "have administred an infallible Specific; but as it is, his\n",
      "Misfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure. Tho' all _Babylon_\n",
      "pitied the hard Case of _Zadig_, they equally stood astonish'd at\n",
      "the profound Penetration of _Hermes_. Two Days after the Imposthume\n",
      "broke, without any Application, and _Zadig_ soon after was perfectly\n",
      "recover'd. _Hermes_ thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate\n",
      "Treatise, to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal'd.\n",
      "_Zadig_, however, never thought it worth his while to peruse his\n",
      "learned Lucubrations; but, as soon as ever he could get abroad,\n",
      "determin'd to pay the Lady a Visit, who had testified such uncommon\n",
      "Concern for his Welfare, and for whose Sake alone he wish'd for the\n",
      "Restoration of his Sight. _Semira_ he found had been out of Town for\n",
      "three Days; but was inform'd, by the bye, that his intended Spouse,\n",
      "having conceived an implacable Aversion to a one-ey'd Man, was that\n",
      "very Night to be married to _Orcan_. At this unexpected ill News,\n",
      "poor _Zadig_ was perfectly thunder-struck: He laid his Disappointment\n",
      "so far to Heart, that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton,\n",
      "and was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards. At last,\n",
      "however, by Dint of Reflection, he got the better of his Distemper;\n",
      "and the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent, in some Measure,\n",
      "contributed towards his Consolation.\n",

      "had but lately pupp'd. As I observ'd likewise some other Traces, in\n",
      "some Degree different, which seem'd to have graz'd all the Way upon\n",
      "the Surface of the Sand, on the Side of the fore-Feet, I knew well\n",
      "enough she must have had long Ears. And forasmuch as I discern'd;\n",
      "with some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less\n",
      "hollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I\n",
      "conceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat\n",

      "Place, the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane, which was but seven\n",
      "Foot broad, was here and there swept off, both on the Right and on\n",

      "been lately fallen on the Ground, and I was sensible the Horse must\n",

      "high. As to the Bits of his Bridle, I knew they must be of Gold, and\n",

      "the Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid\n",

      "\n",
      "The Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,\n",
      "from his Preferment; but more from his intrinsic Merit. Every Day he\n",
      "had familiar Converse with the King, his Royal Master, and his\n",
      "august Consort, _Astarte_. And the Pleasure arising from thence was\n",
      "greatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in\n",
      "regard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and\n",
      "graceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she\n",
      "was at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;\n",
      "yet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the\n",
      "least Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly\n",
      "pleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of\n",
      "her Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was\n",
      "continually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the\n",
      "Subject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who\n",
      "were as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated\n",
      "Discourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,\n",
      "than she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send\n",
      "_Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the\n",
      "Result of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no\n",
      "more of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who\n",
      "was perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and\n",
      "Affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who\n",
      "had such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his\n",
      "late loving Spouse, that would innocently have cut his Nose off. The\n",
      "Freedoms which _Astarte_ took, her tender Expressions, at which she\n",
      "began to blush, the Glances of her Eye, which she would turn away,\n",
      "if perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of\n",
      "_Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could\n",
      "to smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to\n",
      "his Aid; but all in vain, for no Consolation arose from those\n",
      "Reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before\n",
      "his Eyes, as avenging Deities: He bravely struggled; he triumph'd\n",
      "indeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to\n",
      "check every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not\n",
      "talk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too\n",
      "engaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was\n",
      "forc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,\n",
      "against his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,\n",
      "that tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd\n",
      "in Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with\n",
      "each other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in\n",
      "Despair; his Heart was over-charg'd with a Burthen, too great for\n",
      "him to bear: In the Heat of his Conflicts, he disclos'd the Secrets\n",
      "of his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long\n",
      "groan'd under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind, at\n",
      "once makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans, as it\n",
      "were, extorted from him, and by the Drops of a cold Sweat, that\n",
      "trickled down his Cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cador_ said to him; 'tis now some considerable Time since, I have\n",
      "discover'd that secret Passion which you have foster'd in your\n",
      "Bosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The\n",
      "Passions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they\n",
      "cannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own\n",
      "Accuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King\n",
      "has not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other\n",
      "Foible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You\n",
      "take more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the\n",
      "Queen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in\n",
      "short, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her\n",
      "Eyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does\n",
      "not think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,\n",
      "to her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I\n",
      "tremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.\n",
      "Were you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other\n",
      "from all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out\n",
      "into a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself\n",
      "with Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully\n",
      "violating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor; and never was there a\n",
      "more loyal Subject to a Prince, tho' guilty of an involuntary Crime.\n",
      "The Queen, however, repeated the Name of _Zadig_ so often, and her\n",
      "Cheeks glow'd with such a red, when ever she utter'd it; she was one\n",
      "while so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the\n",
      "Discourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a\n",
      "Reverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,\n",
      "that her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd\n",
      "of every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand\n",
      "Things he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_\n",
      "Sandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the\n",
      "Queen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:\n",
      "These were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind\n",
      "to reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,\n",
      "Suspicions were converted into real Facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and\n",
      "Queens: They soon discover'd that _Astarte_ was fond, and _Moabdar_\n",
      "jealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as\n",
      "ever; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by\n",
      "Nature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,\n",
      "wrote an anonymous Letter to _Moabdar_, the infamous Recourse of\n",
      "sordid Spirits, who are the Objects of universal Contempt; but in\n",
      "this Case, an Affair of the last Importance; because this Letter\n",
      "tallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In\n",
      "short, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd\n",
      "to poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_\n",
      "strangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly\n",
      "given to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his\n",
      "Vengeance. At that critical Conjuncture, there happen'd to be a\n",
      "Dwarf, who was dumb, but not deaf, in the King's Apartment. Nobody\n",
      "regarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and\n",
      "yet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This\n",
      "little Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and\n",
      "_Zadig_: He heard, with equal Horror and Surprize, the King's Orders\n",
      "to destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put\n",
      "into Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He\n",
      "could not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and\n",
      "take a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating\n",
      "with Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus\n",
      "attended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly\n",
      "incens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,\n",
      "a Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,\n",
      "expiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,\n",
      "and laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to\n",
      "denote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of\n",
      "Day. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of\n",
      "_Astarte's_ Female Favourites, then in waiting, call'd her up, and\n",
      "gave her to understand, that she must carry the Draught to _Astarte_\n",
      "that very Moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean Time, the Queen's Attendants, tho' it was Dead of Night,\n",
      "knock'd at the Door of _Zadig's_ Apartment, wak'd him, and deliver'd\n",
      "into his Hands a Billet from the Queen. At first he could not well\n",
      "tell whether he was only in a Dream or not, but soon read the\n",
      "Letter, with a trembling Hand, and a heavy Heart: Words can't\n",
      "express his Surprise, and the Agonies of Despair which he was in\n",
      "upon his perusal of the Contents. _Fly_, said she, _Dear_ Zadig,\n",
      "_this very Moment; for your Life's in the utmost Danger: Fly, Dear_\n",
      "Zadig, _I conjure you, in the Name of that fatal Passion, with which\n",
      "I have long struggled, and which I now venture to discover, as I\n",
      "am to make Atonement for it, in a few Moments, by the Loss of my\n",
      "Life. Tho' I am conscious to myself of my Innocence, I find I am to\n",
      "feel the Weight of my Husband's Resentment, and die the Death of a\n",
      "Traitor._\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ was scarce able to speak. He order'd his Friend _Cador_ to\n",
      "be instantly call'd, and gave him the Letter the Moment he came,\n",
      "without opening his Lips. _Cador_ press'd him to regard the\n",
      "Contents, and to make the best of his Way to _Memphis_. If you\n",
      "presume, said he, to have an Interview with her Majesty first, you\n",
      "inevitably hasten her Execution; or if you wait upon the King, the\n",
      "fatal Consequence will be the same: I'll prevent her unhappy Fate,\n",
      "if possible; you follow but your own: I'll give it out, that you are\n",
      "gone to the _Indies_: I'll wait on you as soon as the Hurricane is\n",
      "blown over, and I'll let you know all that occurs material in\n",
      "_Babylon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cador_, that Instant, order'd two of the fleetest Dromedaries that\n",
      "could be got, to be in readiness at a private Back-Door belonging to\n",
      "the Court; he help'd _Zadig_ to mount his Beast, tho' ready to drop\n",
      "into the Earth. He had but one trusty Servant to attend him, and\n",
      "_Cador_, overwhelm'd with Grief, soon lost Sight of his dearly\n",
      "beloved Friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "This illustrious Fugitive soon reach'd the Summit of a little Hill,\n",
      "that afforded him a fair Prospect of the whole City of _Babylon_:\n",
      "But turning his Eyes back towards the Queen's Palace, he fainted\n",
      "away; and when he had recover'd his Senses, he drown'd his Eyes in a\n",
      "Flood of Tears, and with Impatience wish'd for Death. To conclude,\n",
      "after he had reflected, with Horror, on the deplorable Fate of the\n",
      "most amiable Creature in the Universe, and of the most meritorious\n",
      "Queen that ever liv'd; he for a Moment commanded his Passion, and\n",
      "with a Sigh, made the following Exclamations: What is this mortal\n",
      "Life! O Virtue, Virtue, of what Service hast thou been to me! Two\n",
      "young Ladies, a Mistress, and a Wife, have prov'd false to me; a\n",
      "third, who is perfectly innocent, and ten thousand Times handsomer\n",
      "than either of them, has suffer'd Death, 'tis probable, before this,\n",
      "on my Account! All the Acts of Benevolence which I have shewn, have\n",
      "been the Foundation of my Sorrows, and I have been only rais'd to\n",
      "the highest Spoke of Fortune's Wheel, for no other Purpose than to\n",
      "be tumbled down with the greater Force. Had I been as abandon'd as\n",
      "some Miscreants are, I had like them been happy. His Head thus\n",
      "overwhelm'd with these melancholy Reflections, his Eyes thus sunk in\n",
      "his Head, and his meagre Cheeks all pale and languid; and, in a\n",
      "Word, his very Soul thus plung'd in the Abyss of deep Despair, he\n",

      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ steer'd his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head.\n",
      "The Constellation of Orion, and the radiant Dog-star directed him\n",
      "towards the Pole of Canope. He reflected with Admiration on those\n",
      "immense Globes of Light, which appear'd to the naked Eye no more\n",
      "than little twinkling Lights; whereas the Earth he was then\n",
      "traversing, which, in Reality, is no more than an imperceptible\n",
      "Point in Nature, seem'd, according to the selfish Idea we generally\n",
      "entertain of it, something very immense, and very magnificent. He\n",
      "then reflected on the whole Race of Mankind, and look'd upon them,\n",
      "as they are in Fact, a Parcel of Insects, or Reptiles, devouring one\n",
      "another on a small Atom of Clay. This just Idea of them greatly\n",
      "alleviated his Misfortunes, recollecting the Nothingness, if we may\n",
      "be allow'd the Expression, of his own Being, and even of _Babylon_\n",
      "itself. His capacious Soul now soar'd into Infinity, and he\n",
      "contemplated, with the same Freedom, as if she was disencumber'd\n",
      "from her earthly Partner, on the immutable Order of the Universe.\n",
      "But as soon as she cower'd her Wings, and resumed her native Seat,\n",
      "he began to consider that _Astarte_ might possibly have lost her\n",
      "Life for his Sake; upon which, his Thoughts of the Universe vanish'd\n",
      "all at once, and no other Objects appear'd before his distemper'd\n",
      "Eyes, but his _Astarte_ giving up the Ghost, and himself overwhelm'd\n",
      "with a Sea of Troubles: As he gave himself up to this Flux and\n",
      "Reflux of sublime Philosophy and Anxiety of Mind, he was insensibly\n",
      "arriv'd on the Frontiers of _Egypt_: And his trusty Attendant had,\n",
      "unknown to him, stept into the first Village, and sought out for a\n",
      "proper Apartment for his Master and himself. _Zadig_ in the mean\n",
      "Time made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens; where he saw,\n",
      "not far distant from the High-way, a young Lady, all drown'd in\n",
      "Tears, calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress,\n",
      "and a Man, fir'd with Rage and Resentment, in pursuit after her. He\n",
      "had now just overtaken her, and she fell prostrate at his Feet\n",
      "imploring his Forgiveness. He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches;\n",
      "nor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner. By\n",
      "the _Egyptian's_ cruel Deportment towards her, he concluded that the\n",
      "Man was a jealous Husband, and that the Lady was an Inconstant, and\n",
      "had defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a\n",
      "perfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate\n",
      "_Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the\n",
      "Lady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's\n",
      "sake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart\n",
      "would break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:\n",
      "Save, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_\n",
      "threw himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And\n",
      "as he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated\n",
      "with him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd\n",
      "with the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some\n",
      "Pity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,\n",
      "to the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of\n",
      "Nature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one\n",
      "who lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no\n",
      "other Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the\n",
      "jealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her\n",
      "Gallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this\n",
      "Moment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold\n",
      "of the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes\n",
      "up his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to\n",
      "plunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,\n",
      "warded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance\n",
      "towards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch\n",
      "it away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the\n",
      "_Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former\n",
      "made a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter\n",
      "parried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a\n",
      "Grass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more\n",
      "nimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided\n",
      "by his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at\n",
      "random. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and\n",
      "disarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was\n",
      "hotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by\n",
      "Dint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and\n",
      "tripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to\n",
      "his Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,\n",
      "fir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his\n",
      "Dagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor\n",
      "generously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being\n",
      "incens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.\n",
      "_Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the\n",
      "softest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,\n",
      "tho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and\n",
      "deliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man\n",
      "I ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure\n",
      "with me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!\n",
      "I could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had\n",
      "one of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you\n",
      "most unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you\n",
      "call'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to\n",
      "beat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be\n",
      "beat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God\n",
      "that he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more\n",
      "astonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,\n",
      "said to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that\n",
      "you tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my\n",
      "Turn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,\n",
      "he remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the\n",
      "Village: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd\n",
      "upon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They\n",
      "rode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.\n",
      "There she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the\n",
      "Description we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her\n",
      "dead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to\n",
      "_Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once\n",
      "more deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your\n",
      "Pardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand\n",
      "my Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most\n",
      "obedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight\n",
      "for one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool\n",
      "now, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure\n",
      "you, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled\n",
      "so fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,\n",
      "that the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd\n",
      "from King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the\n",
      "Haste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what\n",
      "should be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those\n",
      "_Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what\n",

      "the most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.\n",
      "_Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd\n",
      "them both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they\n",

      "on the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that\n",
      "my impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;\n",
      "every Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and\n",
      "unaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at\n",
      "_Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In\n",
      "the next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his\n",

      "Gallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on\n",
      "boldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have\n",
      "a happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these\n",
      "_Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and\n",
      "I, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This\n",
      "Master of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves\n",
      "with some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his\n",

      "paid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;\n",
      "because the former was the most able to load the Camels; and\n",
      "therefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his\n",

      "The Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown\n",
      "upon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.\n",
      "_Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching\n",
      "under their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason\n",
      "thereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The\n",
      "Merchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and\n",
      "look'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,\n",
      "perceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing\n",

      "Weight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an\n",
      "equal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best\n",
      "Ways and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit\n",
      "for Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a\n",
      "perfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man\n",

      "and thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an\n",
      "_Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy\n",
      "Situation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was\n",
      "it, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that\n",
      "ungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the\n",
      "Foot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said\n",
      "_Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd\n",
      "_Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,\n",
      "active Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the\n",
      "worst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly\n",
      "Fellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of\n",
      "your Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he\n",
      "summon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was\n",
      "sat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of\n",
      "Equity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the\n",
      "Defendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,\n",
      "and would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses\n",
      "ready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but\n",
      "there is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was\n",
      "deposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the\n",
      "Stone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will\n",
      "give, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence\n",
      "will order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the\n",
      "Court, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger\n",
      "to fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very\n",

      "Stone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will\n",
      "require fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied\n",
      "_Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very\n",
      "material Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where\n",
      "the Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone\n",
      "the Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was\n",

      "_Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,\n",
      "till he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver, which were\n",

      "to say, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, according to the antient Custom of\n",

      "Precaution on so important a Topick. But at last told him, in direct\n",
      "Terms, that they were created Bodies, as others, tho' of less\n",
      "Lustre, and that there was no more Adoration due to them, than to a\n",
      "Stock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom\n",
      "we are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;\n",
      "they regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite\n",
      "Distance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore\n",
      "them. You are more indebted, said _Zadig_, to the Waters of the Red\n",

      "Why, pray, may not they be deem'd as antient as the Stars? And if\n",

      "Night: And as soon as he perceiv'd his Patron to be at the Door, he\n",
      "fell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax-Lights. O ye everlasting,\n",

      "_Zadig_. Having repeated these Words so loud as _Setoc_ might hear\n",

      "_Setoc_ took the Hint, and was conscious of the Reproof that was\n",

      "she must throw herself headlong upon her Husband's Funeral-Pile.\n",
      "This was look'd upon as a solemn Festival, and was call'd the\n",

      "Juncture, to be dead, and his Widow (_Almona_ by Name) who was a\n",

      "to throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's\n",
      "Funeral Pile, and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets.\n",
      "_Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,\n",

      "Widows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they\n",
      "might be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new\n",
      "Subjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal\n",
      "Indulgence. And, by arguing seriously with _Setoc_ for some Time, he\n",

      "make away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes\n",
      "with a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for\n",

      "groundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.\n",
      "But, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our\n",
      "Custom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in\n",
      "being burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock\n",
      "indeed to Nature; but must be complied with for all that. I am a\n",
      "profess'd Devotee, and should I shew the least Reluctance, my\n",

      "Appearance than common Madder upon a Shrub; and the whitest Wool,\n",

      "short, at once, and agreed to sign upon her Compliance. She suffer'd\n",

      "trembling, scarce able to hold his Net in his Hand, (which he seem'd\n",

      "very well known, was ever so noted for selling Cream-Cheeses as\n",

      "more wretched than myself? His Benevolence, and good Will to save\n",
      "the poor Man's Life, was as quick as the Reflection he had just\n",

      "'Tis an old saying, that a Person is less unhappy when he sees\n",
      "himself not singular in Misfortune. But if we will credit\n",
      "_Zoroaster_, this is not from a Principle of Malignity, but the\n",

      "Suburbs of _Babylon_, I was inform'd, that not only the Queen, but\n",
      "_Zadig_ too had privately left the Court: Whereupon I ran directly\n",

      "No sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and\n",
      "to fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead\n",
      "of Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me\n",
      "directly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who\n",
      "was his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that\n",
      "stands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,\n",
      "touches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or\n",
      "rather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and\n",
      "furnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and\n",
      "loyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of\n",
      "Day into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,\n",
      "black Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.\n",
      "Whilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus\n",
      "employ'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with\n",
      "the silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us\n",
      "were fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the\n",
      "more artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us\n",
      "both, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that\n",
      "Villain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;\n",
      "and your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to\n",
      "_Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never\n",
      "expos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in\n",
      "the Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they\n",
      "had no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as\n",
      "it had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all\n",
      "Probability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on\n",
      "the Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very\n",
      "disconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to\n",
      "themselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her\n",
      "Complaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their\n",
      "gross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but\n",
      "after he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was\n",
      "extremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I\n",
      "have been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language\n",
      "signifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as\n",
      "much Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In\n",
      "short, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple\n",
      "in publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far\n",
      "in her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of\n",
      "a perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in\n",
      "her Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She\n",
      "insisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a\n",
      "Saraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so\n",
      "preposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing\n",
      "would serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand\n",
      "Master of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took\n",
      "the Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,\n",
      "however, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his\n",
      "Place for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of\n",
      "the Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and\n",
      "made her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and\n",
      "Confidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of\n",
      "_Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.\n",
      "The King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he\n",
      "would have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd\n",
      "all his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.\n",
      "He came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I\n",
      "saw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was\n",
      "enclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings\n",
      "on his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but\n",
      "hollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of\n",
      "Kings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant\n",
      "o'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent\n",
      "Wife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._\n",
      "_Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he\n",
      "ador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle\n",
      "that I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new\n",
      "Spouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In\n",
      "short, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which\n",
      "seem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His\n",
      "Subjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.\n",
      "_Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,\n",
      "became the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was\n",
      "taken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up\n",
      "at the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to\n",
      "_Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to\n",
      "_Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine\n",
      "Broils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third\n",
      "Party, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with\n",
      "his fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was\n",
      "so closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his\n",
      "Retreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for\n",
      "my own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and\n",
      "taken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the\n",
      "Presence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_\n",
      "stood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the\n",
      "Prince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but\n",
      "then, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd\n",
      "me to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that\n",
      "as soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,\n",
      "which would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would\n",
      "honour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was\n",
      "under, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations\n",
      "to _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of\n",
      "_Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a\n",
      "_Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of\n",
      "my high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that\n",
      "Heav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of\n",
      "Majesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an\n",
      "angry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those\n",
      "audacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I\n",
      "talk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile\n",
      "Domestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me\n",
      "one Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was\n",
      "very impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very\n",
      "pretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,\n",
      "and put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one\n",
      "of his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which\n",
      "was somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a\n",
      "little Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive\n",
      "him, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,\n",
      "I would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like\n",
      "me, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;\n",
      "and then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man\n",
      "would part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her\n",
      "gilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of\n",
      "the Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly\n",
      "devoted to her _Zadig_!\n",
      "\n",
      "At these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and\n",
      "bath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the\n",
      "most courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her\n",
      "Narration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the\n",
      "Tyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a\n",
      "Slave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in\n",
      "_Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and\n",
      "Place, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute\n",
      "Circumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in\n",
      "her Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in\n",
      "_Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.\n",
      "Beauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier\n",
      "Disposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young\n",
      "Prince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out\n",
      "some Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady\n",
      "Regent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly\n",
      "Assistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,\n",
      "(cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took\n",
      "care to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an\n",
      "old _Egyptian_ Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious\n",
      "Free-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was\n",
      "strolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to\n",
      "yonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He\n",
      "purchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I\n",
      "was. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good\n",
      "Eating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty\n",
      "sent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his\n",
      "unruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every\n",
      "Moment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so\n",
      "unmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can\n",
      "persuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at\n",
      "him, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has\n",
      "intimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing\n",
      "will restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon\n",
      "the grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,\n",
      "whoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,\n",
      "for him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I\n",
      "have others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a\n",
      "less Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since\n",
      "I have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth\n",
      "the virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;\n",
      "and reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in\n",
      "Distress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over\n",
      "all the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy\n",
      "and Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended\n",
      "on _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was\n",
      "fruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be\n",
      "introduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address\n",
      "was to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from\n",
      "Heaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a\n",
      "Physician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of\n",
      "the dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_\n",
      "with me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour\n",
      "of your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I\n",
      "request, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has\n",
      "been in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to\n",
      "be your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most\n",
      "illustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly\n",
      "discharg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,\n",
      "according to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear\n",
      "every Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new\n",
      "Patient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very\n",
      "affectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to\n",
      "each other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it\n",
      "is written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable\n",
      "_Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of\n",
      "Affection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure\n",
      "Dictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a\n",
      "deeper Impression on hers, than she thought proper to discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;\n",
      "my _Basilisk_, Sir, as others are, is not to be drest or eaten; but\n",
      "all its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;\n",
      "I have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,\n",
      "full-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must\n",
      "kick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour\n",
      "together, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can. This\n",
      "Medicine must be repeated every Morning, and I'll attend the\n",
      "Operation: Upon your due Observance of the Regimen I shall put you\n",
      "under, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest\n",
      "Endeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an\n",
      "Adept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was\n",
      "ready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with\n",
      "the Fatigue. The second Day did not prove altogether so irksome, and\n",
      "he slept much better at Night than he had done before. In short, our\n",
      "Doctor in about eight Days Time, perform'd an absolute Cure. His\n",
      "Patient was as brisk, active and gay, as One in the Bloom of his\n",
      "Youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Sir, said _Zadig_, I'll be ingenuous with you, and disclose to\n",
      "you the important Secret. You have play'd at Foot-ball these eight\n",
      "Days successively; and you have liv'd all that Time, within the\n",
      "Bounds of Sobriety and Moderation. Know, Sir, that there is no such\n",
      "Animal in Nature as a _Basilisk_; that Health is to be secur'd by\n",
      "Temperance and Exercise; and that the Art of making Health\n",
      "consistent with Luxury, is altogether as impracticable, and an Art,\n",
      "in all Respects, as idle and chimerical, as those of the\n",

      "illustrious and so beautiful a Personage, that had run thro' such a\n",
      "long Series of Misfortunes. _Babylon_ at that Time seem'd to be\n",
      "perfectly serene and quiet. As for the young Prince of _Hyrcania_,\n",
      "he was slain in Battle. The _Babylonians_, who were the Victors,\n",
      "declar'd that _Astarte_ should marry that Candidate for the Crown,\n",
      "who should gain it by a fair and impartial Election. They were\n",

      "namely, that of being the Royal Consort of _Astarte_, and the\n",
      "Sovereign of _Babylon_, should be the Result of Merit only; and not\n",
      "be procur'd by any Party-Factions or Court-Intrigues. A solemn Oath\n",
      "was voluntarily taken by all Parties, that he who should distinguish\n",

      "a distinct Apartment to himself behind the _Lists_, where no Soul\n",
      "could either see them, or know who they were. They were to enter the\n",

      "Grandee, one _Itabod_ by Name, immensely rich, indeed, and very\n",
      "haughty; but no ways couragious; exceedingly awkward, and a Man of\n",
      "no acquir'd Parts. The Sycophants that hover'd round about him\n",
      "flatter'd him, that a Man of his Merit couldn't fail of being King:\n",
      "He imperiously replied, One of my Merit must be King: Whereupon he\n",
      "was arm'd _Cap-a-pee_. His Armour was made of pure Gold, enamell'd\n",
      "with Green. The Housings of his Saddle were green, and his Lance\n",
      "embellish'd with green Ribbands. Every One was sensible, at first\n",
      "Sight, by _Itobad's_ Manner of managing his Horse, that he was not\n",
      "the Man whom Heav'n had pitch'd upon to sway the _Babylonish_\n",
      "Scepter. The first Combatant that tilted with him, threw him out of\n",
      "the Saddle; the second flung him quite over the Crupper, and laid\n",
      "him sprawling on the Ground, with his Heels quiv'ring in the Air.\n",
      "_Itobad_, 'tis true, remounted, but with so ill a Grace, that an\n",
      "universal Laugh went round the Amphitheatre. The third, disdaining\n",
      "to use his Lance, made only a Feint at him: Then catch'd hold of his\n",
      "Right Leg, and whirling him round, threw him flat upon the Sand. The\n",
      "Esquires, who were the Attendants, ran to his Assistance, and with a\n",
      "Sneer remounted him. The fourth Combatant catch'd hold of his Left\n",
      "Leg, and unhors'd him again. He was convey'd thro' the hissing\n",
      "Multitude to his Lodge, where, according to the Law in that Case\n",
      "provided, he was to pass the Night. And as he hobbled along, said\n",
      "he, to the Esquires, what a sad Misfortune is this to One of my\n",
      "Birth and Character!\n",
      "\n",
      "The other Champions play'd their Parts much better; and all came off\n",
      "with Credit. Some conquer'd two of their Antagonists, and others\n",
      "were so far successful as to get the better of three. None of them,\n",
      "however, except Prince _Hottam_, vanquish'd four. _Zadig_, at last,\n",
      "enter'd the Lists, and dismounted all his four Opponents, one after\n",
      "the other, with the utmost Ease, and with such an Air and Grace, as\n",
      "gain'd him universal Applause. As the Case stood thus, _Zadig_ and\n",
      "_Hottam_ were to close the Day's Entertainment in a single Combat.\n",
      "The Armour of the latter was of a blue Colour mixt with Gold, and\n",
      "the Housings of his Saddle were of the same. Those of the former\n",
      "white as Snow. The Multitude were divided in their Wishes. The\n",
      "Knight in blue was the Favourite of some of the Ladies; and others\n",
      "again were Admirers of the Cavalier in white. The Queen, whose Heart\n",
      "was in a perfect Palpitation, put up her secret Prayers to _Venus_\n",
      "to assist her darling Hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Champions making their Passes and their Volta's, with the\n",
      "utmost Dexterity and Address, and keeping firm in their Saddles,\n",
      "gave each other such Rebuffs with their Lances, that all the\n",
      "Spectators (the Queen only excepted) wish'd for two Kings of\n",
      "_Babylon_. At last, their Horses being tired, and both their Lances\n",
      "broke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his\n",
      "Antagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,\n",
      "and shooting with a Spring on his Horses Buttocks, grasp'd him\n",
      "close, threw him headlong on the Sand, then jump'd into his Seat,\n",
      "and wheel'd round Prince _Hottam_, while he lay sprawling on the\n",
      "Ground. All the Spectators in general, with loud Acclamations, cried\n",
      "out, Victory! Victory! in favour of the Champion in white. _Hottam_,\n",
      "incens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_\n",
      "sprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the\n",
      "two Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!\n",
      "where they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for\n",
      "both were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their\n",
      "Helmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew\n",
      "about in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times\n",
      "repeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their\n",
      "Swords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the\n",
      "Right, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they\n",
      "retreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd\n",
      "again; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two\n",
      "Serpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions\n",
      "fighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every\n",
      "Blow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment\n",
      "or two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,\n",
      "threw him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried\n",
      "out, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd\n",
      "to be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.\n",
      "The two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the\n",
      "others had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.\n",
      "Several Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them\n",
      "some proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the\n",
      "Queen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy\n",
      "Occasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants\n",
      "to rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the\n",
      "Victor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in\n",
      "order to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the\n",
      "Queen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge\n",
      "contiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He\n",
      "got up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,\n",
      "and substituted his green One in its Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly\n",
      "undaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was\n",
      "the mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he\n",
      "gain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was\n",
      "awake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,\n",
      "return'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of\n",
      "_Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the\n",
      "Amphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could\n",
      "find nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against\n",
      "his Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear\n",
      "in: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made\n",
      "his personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace\n",
      "that were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he\n",
      "took, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks\n",
      "of Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was\n",
      "never sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite\n",
      "out of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,\n",
      "with his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,\n",
      "or how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to\n",
      "have a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour\n",
      "again which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the\n",
      "Engagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:\n",
      "Thus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so\n",
      "on the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and\n",
      "Resentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks\n",
      "of the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star\n",
      "had shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes\n",
      "were irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments\n",
      "from his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd\n",
      "an utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white\n",
      "Armour. See! said he, the fatal Consequence of being a Sluggard! Had\n",
      "I been more vigilant, I had been King of _Babylon_; but what is\n",
      "more, I had been happy in the Embraces of my dearest _Astarte_. All\n",
      "the Knowledge of Books or Mankind; all the personal Valour that I\n",
      "can boast of, has only prov'd an Aggravation of my Sorrows. He\n",
      "carried the Point so far at last, as to murmur at the unequal\n",
      "Dispensations of Divine Providence; and was tempted to believe, that\n",
      "all Occurrences were govern'd by a malignant Destiny, which never\n",
      "fail'd to oppress the Virtuous, and always crown'd the Actions of\n",
      "such Villains as the green Knight, with uncommon Success. In one of\n",
      "his frantick Fits, he put on the green Armour, that had created him\n",
      "such a World of Disgrace. A Merchant happening to pass by, he sold\n",
      "it to him for a Trifle, and took in Exchange nothing more than a\n",
      "Mantle, and a Cap. In this Disguise, he took a solitary Walk along\n",
      "the Banks of the _Euphrates_, every Minute reflecting in his Mind on\n",
      "the partial Proceedings of Providence, which never ceas'd to torment\n",
      "him.\n",

      "_The_ HERMIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey\n",
      "and venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a\n",
      "little Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in\n",
      "his Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the\n",
      "Compliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a\n",
      "Stranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the\n",
      "Treatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the\n",
      "Hermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put\n",
      "the Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect\n",
      "Master of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.\n",
      "This rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the\n",
      "good Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If\n",
      "you'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I\n",
      "may be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments\n",
      "of Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret\n",
      "Regard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He\n",
      "found, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person\n",
      "he had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,\n",
      "Morality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and\n",
      "Vice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that\n",
      "_Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd\n",
      "earnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.\n",
      "That Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to\n",
      "me by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,\n",
      "let me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both\n",
      "pursu'd their Journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The\n",
      "Hermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young\n",
      "Comrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,\n",
      "let them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he\n",
      "conducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every\n",
      "rich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper\n",
      "afterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they\n",
      "were taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd\n",
      "with as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.\n",
      "When they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden\n",
      "Bason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to\n",
      "go to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;\n",
      "and the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for\n",
      "their mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were\n",
      "dismiss'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the\n",
      "Road, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat\n",
      "too haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out\n",
      "of his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's\n",
      "Garment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon\n",
      "saw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off\n",
      "the Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;\n",
      "but was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the\n",
      "Hermit rapp'd at a petty Cottage with his Staff, the beggarly\n",
      "Residence of an old, rich Miser. He desir'd that he and his\n",
      "Companion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,\n",
      "shabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,\n",
      "and carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few\n",
      "musty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit\n",
      "seem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At\n",
      "last, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old\n",
      "Valet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they\n",
      "had been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that\n",
      "he fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of\n",
      "Gold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his\n",
      "Gratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I\n",
      "would willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The\n",
      "Valet, thunder-struck at his unexpected Gratuity, comply'd with his\n",
      "Request: Most hospitable Sir, said the Hermit, I couldn't go away\n",
      "without returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly\n",
      "Reception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this\n",
      "Golden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser\n",
      "started, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so\n",
      "valuable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of\n",
      "his Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.\n",
      "Father, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to\n",
      "me to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of\n",
      "Mankind. You plunder One, who entertain'd you with all the Pomp and\n",
      "Profusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who\n",
      "treated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that\n",
      "Grandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than\n",
      "to gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the\n",
      "Furniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and\n",
      "the Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be\n",
      "surpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and\n",
      "couldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater\n",
      "Wisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an\n",
      "Ascendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he\n",
      "couldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very\n",
      "commodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,\n",
      "and yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had\n",
      "retir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his\n",
      "Mind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the\n",
      "Reception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without\n",
      "Ostentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a\n",
      "Time, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious\n",
      "Apartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet\n",
      "elegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the\n",
      "late Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the\n",
      "Queen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the\n",
      "Lists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a\n",
      "King of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at\n",
      "this unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his\n",
      "Misfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this\n",
      "World took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest\n",
      "Patriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence\n",
      "are often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for\n",
      "casting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare\n",
      "Inspection of the minutest Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said\n",
      "_Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,\n",
      "they are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,\n",
      "'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing\n",
      "without them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then\n",
      "there is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is\n",
      "dangerous, yet All are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and\n",
      "the Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,\n",
      "said he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he\n",
      "receives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,\n",
      "proceed from a superior Cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such\n",
      "vile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the\n",
      "proper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry\n",
      "way agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,\n",
      "thanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers\n",
      "to his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to\n",
      "defray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect\n",
      "and Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.\n",
      "The Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd\n",
      "to set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very\n",
      "affectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more\n",
      "than common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the\n",
      "Hermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in\n",
      "Praise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old\n",
      "Hermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but\n",
      "as all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my\n",
      "Respect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words\n",
      "out of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set\n",
      "the Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd\n",
      "out, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of\n",
      "such a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by\n",
      "a superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got\n",
      "at a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,\n",
      "turn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,\n",
      "our fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense\n",
      "Treasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his\n",
      "Beneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.\n",
      "_Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their\n",
      "last Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and\n",
      "well-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of\n",
      "Age. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She\n",
      "entertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House\n",
      "afforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an\n",
      "adjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days\n",
      "before, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When\n",
      "they were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the\n",
      "Hermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her\n",
      "last Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair\n",
      "of his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went\n",
      "the little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;\n",
      "but was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of\n",
      "Villains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to\n",
      "view my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd\n",
      "but one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who\n",

      "Suppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in\n",
      "Nature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be\n",
      "another World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that\n",

      "on that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd\n",
      "in the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious\n",
      "Outer-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the Ænigmas, and give\n",
      "the wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand\n",
      "Magus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,\n",
      "except the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made\n",
      "his Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about\n",
      "him: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were\n",
      "lavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their\n",
      "Sovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a\n",
      "deep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud\n",
      "Acclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had\n",
      "heard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and\n",
      "Despair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she\n",
      "couldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his\n",
      "Accoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the\n",
      "snow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran\n",
      "thro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the\n",
      "same Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into\n",
      "the Assembly-Room except the Knights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,\n",
      "tho' another appears clad in my Armour; but in the mean Time, before\n",
      "I can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into\n",
      "Court, in order to give my Solutions to such Ænigmas as shall be\n",
      "propos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a\n",
      "Man of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted\n",
      "on their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the\n",
      "Affirmative, without the least Opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the\n",
      "longest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and\n",
      "the most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least\n",
      "valu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can\n",
      "possibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute\n",
      "soever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,\n",
      "however Great?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man\n",
      "of his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;\n",
      "'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the\n",
      "Circus. One said, the Solution of the Ænigma propos'd was _Fortune_;\n",
      "others said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_\n",
      "pronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since\n",
      "'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is\n",
      "Time always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so\n",
      "slowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as\n",
      "Time to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's\n",
      "Extent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in\n",
      "part. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of\n",
      "it when 'tis past. Nothing can possibly be done without it; it\n",
      "buries in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to\n",
      "Posterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The\n",
      "Assembly agreed unanimously that _Zadig_ was in the Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Question that was started, was, What is the Thing we\n",
      "receive, without being ever thankful for it; which we enjoy, without\n",
      "knowing how we came by it; which we give away to others, without\n",
      "knowing where 'tis to be found; and which we lose, without being any\n",
      "ways conscious of our Misfortune?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each pass'd his Verdict. _Zadig_ was the only Person that concluded\n",
      "it was LIFE. He solv'd every Ænigma propos'd, with equal Facility.\n",
      "_Itobad_, when he heard the Explications, always said that nothing\n",
      "in the World was more easy, than to solve such obvious Questions;\n",
      "and that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least\n",
      "Hesitation, were he inclin'd to trouble his Head about such Trifles.\n",
      "Other Questions were propos'd in regard to Justice, the sovereign\n",
      "Good, and the Art of Government. _Zadig's_ Answers still carried the\n",
      "greatest Weight. What Pity 'tis, said some who were present, that\n",
      "one of so comprehensive a Genius, should make such a scurvy\n",
      "Cavalier?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most illustrious Grandees, said _Zadig_, I was the Person that had\n",
      "the Honour of being Victor at your Circus; the white Armour, most\n",
      "puissant Lords, was mine. That awkward Warrior there, Lord _Itobad_,\n",
      "dress'd himself in it whilst I was asleep. He imagin'd, it is plain,\n",
      "that it would do him more Honour than his own Green one. Unaccoutred\n",
      "as I am, I am ready, before this august Assembly, to give them\n",
      "incontestable Proof of my superior Skill; to engage with the Usurper\n",
      "of the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet; and\n",
      "to testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired\n",
      "_Hottam_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Itobad_ accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success\n",
      "imaginable. He did not doubt, but being properly accoutred with his\n",
      "Helmet, his Cuirass, and his Bracelets, he should be able to hue\n",
      "down an Antagonist, in his Mantle and Cap, and nothing to skreen him\n",
      "from his Resentment, but a single Sabre. _Zadig_ drew his Sword, and\n",
      "saluted the Queen with it, who view'd him with Transport mix'd with\n",
      "Fear. _Itobad_ drew his, but paid his Compliments to Nobody. He\n",
      "approach'd _Zadig_, as one, whom he imagin'd incapable of making any\n",
      "considerable Resistance. He concluded, 'twas in his Power to cut\n",
      "_Zadig_ into Atoms. _Zadig_, however, knew how to parry the Blow, by\n",
      "dexterously receiving it upon his _Fort_ (as the Swords-men call it)\n",
      "by which Means _Itobad's_ Sword was snapt in two. With that _Zadig_\n",
      "in an Instant clos'd his Adversary, and by his superior Strength, as\n",
      "well as Skill, laid him sprawling on his Back. Then holding the\n",
      "Point of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass, Submit to be\n",
      "stripp'd of your borrow'd Plumes, or you are a dead Man this Moment.\n",
      "_Itobad_, always surpriz'd, that any Disappointment should attend a\n",
      "Man of such exalted Merit as himself, very tamely permitted _Zadig_\n",
      "to disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet, his superb Cuirass,\n",
      "his rich Bracelets, his brilliant Cuisses, or Armour for his Thighs,\n",
      "and other Martial Accoutrements. When _Zadig_ had equipp'd himself\n",
      "_Cap-a-pee_, in his now recover'd Armour, he flew to _Astarte_, and\n",
      "threw himself prostrate at her Feet. _Cador_ prov'd, without any\n",
      "great Difficulty, that the White Armour was _Zadig's_ Property. He\n",
      "was thereupon acknowledg'd King of _Babylon_, by the unanimous\n",
      "Content of the Whole Court; but more particularly with the\n",
      "Approbation of _Astarte_, who after such a long Series of\n",
      "Misfortunes, now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling _Zadig_\n",
      "thought worthy, in the Opinion of the whole World, to be the Partner\n",
      "of her royal Bed. _Itobad_ withdrew, and contented himself with\n",
      "being call'd _my Lord_ within the narrow Compass of his own\n",
      "Domesticks. _Zadig_, in short, was elected King, and was as happy as\n",
      "any Mortal could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he began to reflect on what the Angel _Jesrad_ had said to him:\n",
      "Nay, he reflected so far back as the Story of the _Arabian_ Atom of\n",
      "Dust metamorphosed into a Diamond. The Queen and He ador'd the\n",
      "Divine Providence. _Zadig_ permitted _Missouf_, the Fair Coquet, to\n",
      "make her Conquests where she could. He sent Couriers to bring the\n",
      "Free-booter _Arbogad_ to Court, and gave him an Honourable Military\n",
      "Post in his Army, with a farther Promise of Promotion to the highest\n",

      "future as a Soldier of Honour; but assur'd him at the same Time,\n",

      "commercial Affairs of _Babylon_. _Cador_ was advanc'd to a Post near\n",
      "himself, and was his Favourite Minister at Court, as the just Reward\n",
      "of his past Services. He was, in short, the King's real Friend; and\n",

      "In the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of\n",
      "_Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with\n",
      "an uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on\n",
      "him an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,\n",
      "he knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways\n",
      "self-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of\n",
      "Reason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with\n",
      "an Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that\n",
      "notwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,\n",
      "never so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle\n",
      "Tattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for\n",
      "those rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those\n",
      "insipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,\n",
      "which was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned\n",
      "from the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder\n",
      "full blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty\n",
      "Tempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of\n",
      "the Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He\n",
      "was of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of\n",
      "obliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise\n",
      "Maxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the\n",
      "Dogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite\n",
      "you._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond\n",
      "of no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As\n",
      "he was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient\n",
      "_Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural\n",
      "Philosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of\n",
      "Metaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he\n",
      "knew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that\n",
      "the Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant\n",
      "to the new Philosophy of the Age he liv'd in; and that the Sun was\n",
      "situated in the Center of the Earth; And when the Chief Magi told\n",
      "him, with an imperious Air, that he maintain'd erroneous Principles;\n",
      "and that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which\n",
      "he liv'd, to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis, and\n",
      "that the Year consisted of twelve Months, he knew how to sit still\n",
      "and quiet, without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or\n",
      "Contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As _Zadig_ was immensely rich, and had consequently Friends without\n",
      "Number; and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution, and\n",
      "remarkably handsome; as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of\n",
      "ready and inoffensive Wit: And, in a Word, as his Heart was\n",
      "perfectly sincere and open, he imagin'd himself, in some Measure,\n",
      "qualified to be perfectly happy. For which Purpose he determin'd to\n",
      "marry a gay young Lady (one _Semira_ by name) whose Beauty, Birth\n",
      "and Fortune, render'd her the most desirable Person in all\n",
      "_Babylon_. He had a sincere Affection for her, grounded on Honour,\n",
      "and _Semira_ conceiv'd as tender a Passion for him. They were just\n",
      "upon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of\n",
      "Matrimony, when, as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards\n",
      "one of the Gates of _Babylon_, under the Shade of a Row of\n",
      "Palm-trees, that grew on the Banks of the River _Euphrates_, they\n",
      "were beset by a Band of Ruffians, arm'd with Sabres, Bows and\n",
      "Arrows. They were the Guards, it seems, of young _Orcan_ (Nephew of\n",
      "a certain Minister of State) whom the Parasites, kept by his Uncle,\n",
      "had buoy'd up with a Permission to do, with Impunity, whatever he\n",
      "thought proper. This young Rival, tho' he had none of those internal\n",
      "Qualities to boast of that _Zadig_ had, yet he imagin'd himself a\n",
      "Man of more Power; and for that Reason, was perfectly outrageous to\n",
      "see the other preferr'd before him. This Fit of Jealousy, the Result\n",
      "of mere Vanity, prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love\n",
      "with the fair _Semira_; and fir'd with that amorous Notion, he was\n",
      "determin'd to take her away from _Zadig_, by Dint of Arms. The\n",
      "Ravishers rush'd rudely upon her, and in the Transport of their\n",
      "Rage, drew the Blood of a Beauty, the Sight of whose Charms would\n",
      "have soften'd the very Tigers of Mount _Imaüs_. The injur'd Lady\n",
      "rent the very Heavens with her Exclamations. Where's my dear\n",
      "Husband, she cried? They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man\n",
      "whom I adore. She never reflected on the Danger to which she was\n",
      "expos'd; her sole Concern was for her beloved _Zadig_. At the same\n",
      "Time, he defended her, like a Lover, and a Man of Integrity and\n",
      "Courage. With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants, he put\n",
      "those Sons of Violence to Flight, and conducted _Semira_, bloody as\n",
      "she was, and in fainting Fits, to her own House. No sooner was she\n",
      "come to her self, but she fix'd her lovely Eyes on her Dear\n",
      "Deliverer. O _Zadig_, said she, I love thee as affectionately, as if\n",
      "I were actually thy Bride: I love thee, as the Man, to whom I owe my\n",
      "Life, and what is dearer to me, the Preservation of my Honour. No\n",
      "Heart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of _Semira_. Never\n",
      "did the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds;\n",
      "never did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of\n",
      "Love and Gratitude for his signal Service; never, in short, did the\n",
      "most affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the\n",
      "fondest Husband. Her Wounds, however, were but very superficial, and\n",
      "she was soon recover'd. _Zadig_ receiv'd a Wound that was much more\n",
      "dangerous: An unlucky Arrow had graz'd one of his Eyes, and the\n",
      "Orifice was deep. _Semira_ was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods\n",
      "that they might restore her _Zadig_. Her Eyes were Night and Day\n",
      "overwhelm'd with Tears. She waited with Impatience for the happy\n",
      "Moment, when those of _Zadig_ might dart their Fires upon her; but\n",
      "alas! the wounded Eye grew so inflam'd and swell'd, that she was\n",
      "terrified to the last Degree. She sent as far as _Memphis_ for\n",
      "_Hermes_, the celebrated Physician there, who instantly attended his\n",
      "new Patient with a numerous Retinue. Upon his first Visit, he\n",
      "peremptorily declared that _Zadig_ would lose his Eye; and foretold\n",
      "not only the Day, but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would\n",
      "befal him. Had it been, said that Great Man, his right Eye, I could\n",
      "have administred an infallible Specific; but as it is, his\n",
      "Misfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure. Tho' all _Babylon_\n",
      "pitied the hard Case of _Zadig_, they equally stood astonish'd at\n",
      "the profound Penetration of _Hermes_. Two Days after the Imposthume\n",
      "broke, without any Application, and _Zadig_ soon after was perfectly\n",
      "recover'd. _Hermes_ thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate\n",
      "Treatise, to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal'd.\n",
      "_Zadig_, however, never thought it worth his while to peruse his\n",
      "learned Lucubrations; but, as soon as ever he could get abroad,\n",
      "determin'd to pay the Lady a Visit, who had testified such uncommon\n",
      "Concern for his Welfare, and for whose Sake alone he wish'd for the\n",
      "Restoration of his Sight. _Semira_ he found had been out of Town for\n",
      "three Days; but was inform'd, by the bye, that his intended Spouse,\n",
      "having conceived an implacable Aversion to a one-ey'd Man, was that\n",
      "very Night to be married to _Orcan_. At this unexpected ill News,\n",
      "poor _Zadig_ was perfectly thunder-struck: He laid his Disappointment\n",
      "so far to Heart, that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton,\n",
      "and was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards. At last,\n",
      "however, by Dint of Reflection, he got the better of his Distemper;\n",
      "and the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent, in some Measure,\n",
      "contributed towards his Consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I have met with such an unexpected Repulse, said he, from a\n",
      "capricious Court-Lady, I am determin'd to marry some substantial\n",
      "Citizen's Daughter. He pitch'd accordingly upon _Azora_, a young\n",

      "whose Parents were very rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their Nuptials accordingly were soon after solemniz'd, and for a\n",

      "Promise of some valuable Token of his Respect. _Azora_ had been\n",
      "visiting a Female Companion for two Days together in the Country,\n",

      "Bottom of the Garden. She burst into a Flood of Tears; tore her\n",

      "_Cador_ came, and begg'd the Favour of being introduc'd to the\n",

      "his Effects, and gave her to understand, that he should think\n",
      "himself the happiest Creature in the World, if she would condescend\n",

      "to melt. More Time was spent in Supper than at Dinner. They\n",
      "discoursed together with a little more Freedom. _Azora_ was lavish\n",
      "of her Encomiums on _Zadig_; but then, 'twas true, she said, he had\n",

      "has long Ears. By your exact Description, Sir, you must doubtless\n",

      "hadn't seen the King's Palfrey run by him. No Horse, said _Zadig_,\n",
      "ever gallop'd smoother; he is about five Foot high, his Hoofs are\n",
      "very small; his Tail is about three Foot six Inches long; the studs\n",
      "of his Bit are of pure Gold, about 23 Carats; and his Shoes are of\n",
      "Silver, about Eleven penny Weight a-piece. What Course did he take,\n",

      "Horse away, secur'd him, and carried him before the grand Desterham,\n",
      "who condemn'd him to the _Knout_, and to be confin'd for Life in\n",
      "some remote and lonely Part of _Siberia_. No sooner had the Sentence\n",
      "been pronounc'd, but the Horse and Bitch were both found. The Judges\n",
      "were in some Perplexity in this odd Affair, and yet thought it\n",
      "absolutely necessary, as the Man was innocent, to recal their\n",
      "Decree. However, they laid a Fine upon him of Four Hundred Ounces of\n",

      "Kings. I'll be ingenuous, however, and declare the Truth, and\n",
      "nothing but the Truth. As I was walking by the Thicket's Side, where\n",
      "I met with her Majesty's most venerable chief Eunuch, and the King's\n",
      "most illustrious chief Huntsman, I perceiv'd upon the Sand the\n",
      "Footsteps of an Animal, and I easily inferr'd that it must be a\n",
      "little one. The several small, tho' long Ridges of Land between the\n",
      "Footsteps of the Creature, gave me just Grounds to imagine it was a\n",
      "Bitch whose Teats hung down; and for that Reason, I concluded she\n",
      "had but lately pupp'd. As I observ'd likewise some other Traces, in\n",
      "some Degree different, which seem'd to have graz'd all the Way upon\n",
      "the Surface of the Sand, on the Side of the fore-Feet, I knew well\n",
      "enough she must have had long Ears. And forasmuch as I discern'd;\n",
      "with some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less\n",
      "hollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I\n",
      "conceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat\n",
      "lamish, if I may presume to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the Palfrey of the King of Kings, give me leave to inform you,\n",
      "that as I was walking down the Lane by the Thicket-side, I took\n",
      "particular Notice of the Prints made upon the Sand by a Horse's\n",
      "Shoes; and found that their Distances were in exact Proportion; from\n",
      "that Observation, I concluded the Palfrey gallop'd well. In the next\n",
      "Place, the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane, which was but seven\n",
      "Foot broad, was here and there swept off, both on the Right and on\n",
      "the Left, about three Feet and six Inches from the Middle of the\n",
      "Road. For which Reason I pronounc'd the Tail of the Palfrey to be\n",
      "three Foot and a half long, with which he had whisk'd off the Dust\n",
      "on both Sides as he ran along. Again, I perceiv'd under the Trees,\n",
      "which form'd a Kind of Bower of five Feet high, some Leaves that had\n",
      "been lately fallen on the Ground, and I was sensible the Horse must\n",
      "have shook them off; from whence I conjectur'd he was five Foot\n",
      "high. As to the Bits of his Bridle, I knew they must be of Gold, and\n",
      "of the Value I mention'd; for he had rubb'd the Studs upon a certain\n",
      "Stone, which I knew to be a Touch-stone, by an Experiment that I had\n",
      "made of it. To conclude, by the Prints which his Shoes had left of\n",

      "in the King's Chambers, and his Privy-Council. And notwithstanding\n",

      "did look out of the Window at the same Time, he was sentenc'd to pay\n",
      "five Hundred Ounces of Gold for that Misdemeanor; and moreover, was\n",
      "oblig'd to thank the Court for their Indulgence; a Compliment which\n",
      "the Magistrates of _Babylon_ expect to be paid them. Good God! said\n",
      "he, to himself, have I not substantial Reason to complain, that my\n",

      "As _Zadig_ had met with such a Series of Misfortunes, he was\n",

      "and the Conversation of select Friends. He was still possess'd of a\n",
      "little pretty Box in the Out-parts of _Babylon_, which was furnish'd\n",
      "in a good Taste; where every Artist was welcome, and wherein he\n",
      "enjoy'd all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well\n",
      "wish for. In the Morning, his Library was always open for the Use of\n",
      "the Learned; at Night his Table was fill'd with the most agreeable\n",
      "Companions; but he was soon sensible, by Experience, how dangerous\n",
      "it was to keep learned Men Company. A warm Dispute arose about a\n",
      "certain Law of _Zoroaster_; which prohibited the Eating of Griffins:\n",
      "But to what Purpose said some of the Company, was that Prohibition,\n",
      "since there is no such Animal in Nature? Some again insisted that\n",
      "there must; for otherwise _Zoroaster_ could never have been so weak\n",
      "as to give his Pupils such a Caution. _Zadig_, in order to\n",
      "compromize the Matter, said; Gentlemen, If there are such Creatures\n",
      "in Being, let us never touch them; and if there are not, we are well\n",
      "assur'd we can't touch them; so in either Case we shall comply with\n",

      "embarrass'd _Zadig_, but for the Credit of a Magus, who was Brother\n",
      "to his Friend _Cador_. From that Day forward, _Zadig_ ever\n",
      "distinguish'd and preferr'd good, before learned Company: He\n",
      "associated with the most conversible Men, and the most amiable\n",
      "Ladies in all _Babylon_; he made elegant Entertainments, which were\n",
      "frequently preceded by a Concert of Musick, and enliven'd by the\n",
      "most facetious Conversation, in which, as he had felt the Smart of\n",
      "it, he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit, which is not\n",
      "only the surest Proof that a Man has none, but the most infallible\n",
      "Means to spoil all good Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the Choice of his Friends, nor that of his Dishes, was the\n",
      "Result of Pride or Ostentation. He took Delight in appearing to be,\n",
      "what he actually was, and not in seeming to be what he was not; and\n",
      "by that Means, got a greater real Character than he actually aim'd\n",
      "at.\n",

      "Tho' the rattling of the Chariots which stopp'd at _Zadig's_ Door\n",
      "was a perfect Nuisance to him; yet the good Character which every\n",
      "Body gave him was still a higher Provocation. He would sometimes\n",
      "intrude himself upon _Zadig_, and set down at his Table without any\n",
      "Invitation; when there, he would most certainly interrupt the Mirth\n",

      "short War, commended his Majesty very highly, but was more lavish of\n",
      "his Compliments on the Lady. He took out his Pocket Book, and wrote\n",
      "four extempore Verses on that Occasion, and gave them the Lady to\n",
      "read. The Gentlemen then present begg'd to be oblig'd with a Sight\n",
      "of them, as well as the Lady, But either thro' Modesty, or rather a\n",
      "self-Consciousness that he hadn't happily succeeded, he gave them a\n",
      "flat Denial. He was sensible, that a sudden poetic Flight must prove\n",
      "insipid to every one but the Person in whose Favour it is written,\n",
      "whereupon he snapt the Table in two whereon the Lines were wrote,\n",
      "and threw both Pieces into a Rose-bush, where they were hunted for,\n",
      "but to no Purpose. Soon after it happened to rain, and all the\n",
      "Company flew into the House, but _Arimazes_. Notwithstanding the\n",
      "Shower, he continued in the Garden, and never quitted it, till he\n",
      "had found one Moiety of the Tablet, which was unfortunately broke in\n",
      "such a Manner, that even the half Lines were good sense, and good\n",
      "Metre, tho' very short. But what was still more remarkably\n",

      "Young as _Zadig_ was, he was constituted chief Judge of all the\n",
      "Tribunals throughout the Empire. He fill'd the Place, like one, whom\n",
      "the Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid\n",
      "Wisdom. It was to him, the Nations round about were indebted for\n",
      "that generous Maxim; _that 'tis much more Prudence to acquit two\n",
      "Persons, tho' actually guilty, than to pass Sentence of Condemnation\n",
      "in one that is virtuous and innocent_. It was his firm Opinion, that\n",
      "the Laws were intended to be a Praise to those who did well, as much\n",
      "as to be a Terror to Evildoers. It was his peculiar Talent to render\n",
      "Truth as obvious as possible: Whereas most Men study to render it\n",
      "intricate and obscure. On the very first Day of his Entrance into\n",
      "his High Office, he exerted this peculiar Talent. A rich Merchant,\n",
      "and a Native of _Babylon_, died in the _Indies_. He had made his\n",
      "Will, and appointed his two Sons Joint-Heirs of his Estate, as soon\n",
      "as they had settled their Sister, and married her with their mutual\n",
      "Approbation. Moreover, he left a specific Legacy of 30,000 Pieces of\n",
      "Gold to that Son, who should, after his Decease, be prov'd to love\n",
      "him best. The Eldest erected to his Memory a very costly Monument:\n",
      "The Youngest appropriated a considerable Part of his Bequest to the\n",
      "Augmentation of his Sister's Fortune: Every one, without Hesitation,\n",
      "gave the Preference to the Elder, allowing the Younger to have the\n",
      "greatest Affection for his Sister. The Legacy therefore was\n",
      "doubtless due to the Eldest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their Cause came before _Zadig_, and he examin'd them apart. To the\n",
      "former, said _Zadig_, Your Father, Sir, is not dead, as is reported,\n",
      "but being happily recover'd, is on his Return to _Babylon_. God be\n",
      "praised, said the young Man! but I hope the Expence I have been at\n",
      "in raising this superb Monument will be consider'd. After this,\n",
      "_Zadig_ repeated the same Story to the Younger. God be praised, said\n",
      "he! I will immediately restore all that he has left me; but I hope\n",
      "my Father will not recal the little Present I have made my Sister.\n",
      "You have nothing to restore, Sir; you shall have the Legacy of the\n",

      "willing to marry her. But, said she, he shall be my Husband, that\n",

      "Time after, my Lady was brought to Bed of a hopeful Boy. Each of\n",
      "them insisted on being Tutor, and the Cause was brought before\n",
      "_Zadig_. The two Magi were order'd to appear in Court. Pray Sir,\n",
      "said _Zadig_ to the first, what Method of Instruction do you propose\n",
      "to pursue for the Improvement of your young Pupil? He shall first be\n",
      "grounded, said this learned Pedagogue, in the Eight Parts of Speech;\n",

      "possess'd of a very considerable Estate, notwithstanding he had\n",

      "Violins, as his Attendants; a Head Steward, with six Men Cooks, and\n",
      "4 Chamberlains, who were never to be out of his Sight. The King\n",

      "Eyes, his Musick-Master, with the Voices and Violins, entred his\n",
      "Apartment. They sang a Cantata, that lasted two Hours and three\n",

      "\n",
      "After the Cantata was over, the Chamberlain address'd him in a\n",
      "formal Harangue for three Quarters of an Hour without ceasing;\n",
      "wherein he took Occasion to extol every Virtue to which he was a\n",
      "perfect Stranger; when the Oration was over, he was conducted to\n",
      "Dinner, where the Musicians were all in waiting, and play'd, as soon\n",
      "as he was seated at his Table. Dinner lasted three Hours before he\n",
      "condescended to speak a Word. When he did; you say Right, Sir, said\n",
      "the chief Chamberlain; scarce had he utter'd four Words more, but\n",
      "Right, Sir, said the second. The other two Chamberlain's Time was\n",
      "taken up in laughing with Admiration at _Irax's_ Smart Repartees, or\n",
      "at least such as he ought to have made. After the Cloth was taken\n",

      "exalted Merit. The second wasn't altogether so agreeable; The third\n",
      "prov'd somewhat troublesome; the fourth insupportable; the fifth was\n",
      "tormenting; and at last, he was perfectly outrageous at the\n",
      "continual Peal in his Ears of No Monarch's happier Sir, than you,\n",
      "You say right, _&c._ and at being daily harangu'd at the same Hour.\n",

      "augment his present Felicity. Every Night, however, he had some\n",

      "\n",

      "The Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,\n",
      "from his Preferment; but more from his intrinsic Merit. Every Day he\n",
      "had familiar Converse with the King, his Royal Master, and his\n",
      "august Consort, _Astarte_. And the Pleasure arising from thence was\n",
      "greatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in\n",
      "regard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and\n",
      "graceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she\n",
      "was at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;\n",
      "yet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the\n",
      "least Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly\n",
      "pleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of\n",
      "her Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was\n",
      "continually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the\n",
      "Subject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who\n",
      "were as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated\n",
      "Discourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,\n",
      "than she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send\n",
      "_Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the\n",
      "Result of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no\n",
      "more of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who\n",
      "was perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and\n",
      "Affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who\n",
      "had such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his\n",
      "late loving Spouse, that would innocently have cut his Nose off. The\n",
      "Freedoms which _Astarte_ took, her tender Expressions, at which she\n",
      "began to blush, the Glances of her Eye, which she would turn away,\n",
      "if perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of\n",
      "_Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could\n",
      "to smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to\n",

      "Reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before\n",

      "indeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to\n",
      "check every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not\n",
      "talk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too\n",
      "engaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was\n",
      "forc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,\n",
      "against his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,\n",
      "that tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd\n",
      "in Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with\n",
      "each other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in\n",
      "Despair; his Heart was over-charg'd with a Burthen, too great for\n",
      "him to bear: In the Heat of his Conflicts, he disclos'd the Secrets\n",
      "of his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long\n",
      "groan'd under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind, at\n",
      "once makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans, as it\n",
      "were, extorted from him, and by the Drops of a cold Sweat, that\n",

      "Bosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The\n",
      "Passions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they\n",
      "cannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own\n",
      "Accuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King\n",
      "has not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other\n",
      "Foible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You\n",
      "take more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the\n",
      "Queen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in\n",
      "short, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her\n",
      "Eyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does\n",
      "not think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,\n",
      "to her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I\n",
      "tremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.\n",
      "Were you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other\n",
      "from all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out\n",
      "into a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself\n",
      "with Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully\n",
      "violating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor; and never was there a\n",
      "more loyal Subject to a Prince, tho' guilty of an involuntary Crime.\n",
      "The Queen, however, repeated the Name of _Zadig_ so often, and her\n",
      "Cheeks glow'd with such a red, when ever she utter'd it; she was one\n",
      "while so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the\n",
      "Discourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a\n",
      "Reverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,\n",
      "that her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd\n",
      "of every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand\n",
      "Things he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_\n",
      "Sandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the\n",
      "Queen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:\n",
      "These were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind\n",
      "to reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,\n",
      "Suspicions were converted into real Facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and\n",
      "Queens: They soon discover'd that _Astarte_ was fond, and _Moabdar_\n",
      "jealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as\n",
      "ever; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by\n",
      "Nature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,\n",
      "wrote an anonymous Letter to _Moabdar_, the infamous Recourse of\n",
      "sordid Spirits, who are the Objects of universal Contempt; but in\n",
      "this Case, an Affair of the last Importance; because this Letter\n",
      "tallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In\n",
      "short, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd\n",
      "to poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_\n",
      "strangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly\n",
      "given to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his\n",
      "Vengeance. At that critical Conjuncture, there happen'd to be a\n",
      "Dwarf, who was dumb, but not deaf, in the King's Apartment. Nobody\n",
      "regarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and\n",
      "yet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This\n",
      "little Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and\n",

      "to destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put\n",
      "into Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He\n",
      "could not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and\n",
      "take a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating\n",
      "with Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus\n",
      "attended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly\n",
      "incens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,\n",
      "a Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,\n",
      "expiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,\n",
      "and laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to\n",
      "denote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of\n",
      "Day. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of\n",

      "_Zadig_ steer'd his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head.\n",
      "The Constellation of Orion, and the radiant Dog-star directed him\n",
      "towards the Pole of Canope. He reflected with Admiration on those\n",
      "immense Globes of Light, which appear'd to the naked Eye no more\n",

      "arriv'd on the Frontiers of _Egypt_: And his trusty Attendant had,\n",
      "unknown to him, stept into the first Village, and sought out for a\n",
      "proper Apartment for his Master and himself. _Zadig_ in the mean\n",
      "Time made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens; where he saw,\n",
      "not far distant from the High-way, a young Lady, all drown'd in\n",
      "Tears, calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress,\n",
      "and a Man, fir'd with Rage and Resentment, in pursuit after her. He\n",
      "had now just overtaken her, and she fell prostrate at his Feet\n",
      "imploring his Forgiveness. He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches;\n",
      "nor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner. By\n",
      "the _Egyptian's_ cruel Deportment towards her, he concluded that the\n",
      "Man was a jealous Husband, and that the Lady was an Inconstant, and\n",
      "had defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a\n",
      "perfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate\n",
      "_Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the\n",
      "Lady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's\n",
      "sake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart\n",
      "would break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:\n",
      "Save, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_\n",
      "threw himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And\n",
      "as he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated\n",
      "with him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd\n",
      "with the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some\n",
      "Pity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,\n",
      "to the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of\n",
      "Nature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one\n",
      "who lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no\n",
      "other Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the\n",
      "jealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her\n",
      "Gallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this\n",
      "Moment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold\n",
      "of the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes\n",
      "up his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to\n",
      "plunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,\n",
      "warded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance\n",
      "towards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch\n",
      "it away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the\n",
      "_Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former\n",
      "made a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter\n",
      "parried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a\n",
      "Grass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more\n",
      "nimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided\n",
      "by his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at\n",
      "random. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and\n",
      "disarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was\n",
      "hotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by\n",
      "Dint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and\n",
      "tripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to\n",
      "his Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,\n",
      "fir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his\n",
      "Dagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor\n",
      "generously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being\n",
      "incens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.\n",
      "The _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.\n",
      "_Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the\n",
      "softest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,\n",
      "tho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and\n",
      "deliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man\n",
      "I ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure\n",
      "with me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!\n",
      "I could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had\n",
      "one of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you\n",
      "most unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you\n",
      "call'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to\n",
      "beat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be\n",
      "beat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God\n",
      "that he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more\n",
      "astonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,\n",
      "said to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that\n",
      "you tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my\n",
      "Turn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,\n",
      "he remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the\n",
      "Village: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd\n",
      "upon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They\n",
      "rode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.\n",
      "There she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the\n",
      "Description we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her\n",
      "dead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to\n",
      "_Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once\n",
      "more deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your\n",
      "Pardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand\n",
      "my Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most\n",
      "obedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight\n",
      "for one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool\n",
      "now, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure\n",
      "you, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled\n",
      "so fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,\n",
      "that the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd\n",
      "from King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the\n",
      "Haste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what\n",
      "should be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those\n",
      "_Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what\n",

      "No sooner was _Zadig_ arriv'd at the _Egyptian_ Village\n",
      "before-mention'd, but he found himself surrounded by a Croud. The\n",
      "People one and all cried out! See! See! there's the Man that ran\n",
      "away with the beauteous Lady _Missouf_, and murder'd _Cletofis_.\n",
      "Gentlemen, said he, God forbid that I should ever entertain a\n",
      "Thought of running away with the Lady you speak of: She is too much\n",
      "of a Coquet: And as to _Cletofis_, I did not murder him, but kill'd\n",
      "him in my own Defence. He endeavour'd all he could to take my Life\n",
      "away, because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on\n",
      "the beauteous _Missouf_, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a\n",
      "Stranger, who am fled hither for Shelter, and 'tis highly\n",
      "improbable, that upon my first Entrance into a Country, where I came\n",
      "for Safety and Protection, I should be guilty of two such enormous\n",
      "Crimes, as that of running away with another Man's Partner, and that\n",
      "of clandestinely murdering him on her Account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Egyptians_ at that Time were just and humane. The Populace, tis\n",
      "true, hurried _Zadig_ to the Town-Goal; but they took care in the\n",
      "first Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds, and afterwards\n",
      "examin'd the suppos'd Delinquents apart, in order to discover, if\n",
      "possible, the real Truth. They acquitted _Zadig_ of the Charge of\n",
      "wilful and premeditated Murder; but as he had taken a Subject's Life\n",
      "away, tho' in his own Defence, he was sentenc'd to be a Slave, as\n",
      "the Law directed. His two Beasts were sold in open Market, for the\n",
      "Service of the Hamlet; What Money he had was distributed amongst the\n",
      "Inhabitants; and he and his Attendant were expos'd in the\n",
      "Market-place to public Sale. An _Arabian_ Merchant, _Setoc_ by Name,\n",
      "purchas'd them both; but as the Valet, or Attendant, was a robust\n",
      "Man, and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master, he fetch'd\n",
      "the most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.\n",
      "_Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd\n",
      "them both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they\n",
      "accompanied their Master home. _Zadig_, as they were on the Road,\n",
      "comforted his Fellow-Slave, and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes\n",
      "with Patience: But, according to Custom, he made several Reflections\n",
      "on the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that\n",
      "my impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;\n",
      "every Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and\n",
      "unaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at\n",
      "_Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In\n",
      "the next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his\n",
      "Royal Consort's speaking a little too much in my Favour; and here I\n",
      "am a joint-Slave with thy self; because a turbulent Fellow of a\n",
      "Gallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on\n",
      "boldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have\n",
      "a happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these\n",
      "_Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and\n",
      "I, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This\n",
      "Master of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves\n",
      "with some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his\n",
      "Work. This was his Discourse to his Comrade; but his Mind was more\n",
      "attentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of _Babylon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two Days afterwards _Setoc_ set out with his two Slaves and his\n",
      "Camels, for _Arabia Deserta_. His Tribe liv'd near the Desert of\n",
      "_Horeb_. The Way was long and tedious. _Setoc_, during the Journey,\n",
      "paid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;\n",
      "because the former was the most able to load the Camels; and\n",
      "therefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his\n",
      "Favour. It so happen'd that one of the Camels died upon the Road:\n",
      "The Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown\n",
      "upon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.\n",
      "_Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching\n",
      "under their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason\n",
      "thereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The\n",
      "Merchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and\n",
      "look'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,\n",
      "perceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing\n",
      "him in several material Points, which were in some Measure,\n",
      "advantageous to him in his Way of Business: Such as, the specific\n",
      "Weight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an\n",
      "equal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best\n",
      "Ways and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit\n",
      "for Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a\n",
      "perfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man\n",
      "of the two. He us'd him courteously, and had no Room to repent of\n",
      "his Indulgence towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being got to their Journey's End, the first Step that _Setoc_ took\n",
      "was to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a _Jew_, who\n",
      "had borrow'd it in the Presence of two Witnesses; but both of them\n",
      "were dead; and as the _Jew_ was conscious he couldn't be cast for\n",
      "Want of Evidence, appropriated the Merchant's Money to his own Use,\n",
      "and thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an\n",
      "_Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy\n",
      "Situation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was\n",
      "it, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that\n",
      "ungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the\n",
      "Foot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said\n",
      "_Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd\n",
      "_Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,\n",
      "active Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the\n",
      "worst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly\n",
      "Fellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of\n",
      "your Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he\n",
      "summon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was\n",
      "sat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of\n",
      "Equity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the\n",
      "Defendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,\n",
      "and would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses\n",
      "ready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but\n",
      "there is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was\n",
      "deposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the\n",
      "Stone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will\n",
      "give, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence\n",
      "will order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the\n",
      "Court, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger\n",
      "to fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very\n",
      "reasonable, said the Judge. Do as you propose; and so call'd another\n",
      "Cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Court was ready to break up, Well! said the Judge to\n",
      "_Zadig_, is your Stone come yet? The _Jew_, with a Sneer, replied,\n",
      "your Excellence may wait here till this Time To-morrow, before the\n",
      "Stone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will\n",
      "require fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied\n",
      "_Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very\n",
      "material Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where\n",
      "the Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone\n",
      "the Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was\n",
      "soon oblig'd to acknowledge the Debt. The Judge order'd that the\n",
      "_Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,\n",

      "Stock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom\n",
      "we are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;\n",
      "they regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite\n",
      "Distance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore\n",

      "to throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's\n",

      "_Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,\n",
      "and how directly repugnant to human Nature; by permitting young\n",
      "Widows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they\n",
      "might be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new\n",
      "Subjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal\n",

      "make away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes\n",
      "with a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for\n",

      "groundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.\n",
      "But, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our\n",
      "Custom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in\n",
      "being burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock\n",
      "indeed to Nature; but must be complied with for all that. I am a\n",
      "profess'd Devotee, and should I shew the least Reluctance, my\n",

      "swill'd down whole Bumpers, told a Hundred merry Tales, and swore a\n",
      "thousand Times over, that he was the happiest Creature upon God's\n",
      "Earth; persuading _Zadig_ to be as merry, and thoughtless as\n",
      "himself. At last, being gradually overcome by the Fumes of his\n",

      "for Shelter and Protection: The Favour, I confess, was readily\n",
      "granted to my Wife; but as for my own Part, I was absolutely\n",
      "rejected. She was fairer, Sir, than the fairest Cheese I ever sold;\n",
      "from whence I date all my Misfortunes; and the red that adorn'd her\n",
      "blushing Cheeks was ten Times more lively than any _Tyrian_ Scarlet.\n",
      "And between you and I, Sir, that was the main Cause of my Wife's\n",
      "Reception, and my Disgrace. Whereupon I wrote a doleful Letter to my\n",
      "Wife, in all the Agonies of one in the deepest Despair: 'Tis very\n",
      "well, said she, to the Messenger; I have some little Knowledge of\n",
      "the Man; I have heard say no one sells better Cream-Cheeses than he\n",
      "does; desire him, next Time he comes, to bring a small Parcel with\n",
      "him, and let him know, I'll take care he shall be punctually paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Height of my Misfortunes, I determin'd to seek Redress in a\n",

      "for a Fee to my Counsellor; two to my Lawyer, who took my Cause in\n",
      "Hand, and the other two to the Judge's Clerk. Notwithstanding what I\n",
      "had done, my Cause was not so much as commenc'd; and I had already\n",
      "disburs'd more Money than all my Cheeses and my Wife with them were\n",
      "worth. I return'd therefore to my Native Habitation, with a full\n",
      "Resolution to sell it for the Ransom of my Wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "My little Cot, with the Appurtenances, were worth about threescore\n",
      "Ounces of Gold: But as the Purchasers found I was necessitous, and\n",
      "drove to my last Shifts; the first whom I apply'd to, offer'd me\n",
      "thirty Ounces; the second, twenty; and the third, but ten: Just as I\n",
      "had come to Terms of Accommodation with one of them, the Prince of\n",
      "_Hyrcania_ came to _Babylon_, and swept all before him. My little\n",

      "\n",
      "Having thus lost my Money, my Wife, and my House, I withdrew to this\n",
      "Desart, where you see me. I have since endeavour'd to get my Bread\n",
      "by Fishing; but the Fish, as well as all Mankind, desert me. I\n",

      "this I know, to my Sorrow, that neither the Queen, nor _Zadig_, ever\n",
      "paid me the least Consideration in the World for my Cream Cheeses;\n",
      "that my dear Spouse is taken from me; and that I am drove to the\n",
      "very Brink of Despair. I am verily persuaded, said _Zadig_, that you\n",
      "will not lose all your Money. I have heard much talk of that same\n",

      "an Instrument of Comfort to this poor Man; but what Friend will you\n",
      "raise for me, to alleviate my Sorrows? Having utter'd this short\n",
      "Expostulation, he gave the distrest Fisherman one full Moiety of all\n",

      "\n",
      "In the mean Time, _Zadig_ every now and then ask'd him Questions,\n",
      "and wept as he ask'd them. What! Sir, said the Fisherman, can you,\n",
      "who are so bountiful a Benefactor, be in Distress yourself? Alas!\n",

      "As _Zadig_ was traversing a verdant Meadow, he perceiv'd several\n",
      "young Female _Syrians_, intent on searching for something very\n",
      "curious, that lay conceal'd, as they imagin'd, in the Grass. He took\n",
      "the Freedom to approach one of them, and ask her, in the most\n",
      "courteous Manner, if he might have the Honour to assist her in her\n",
      "Researches. Have a care, said she. What we are hunting after, Sir,\n",
      "is an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man.\n",
      "'Tis somewhat surprizing, said _Zadig_. May I be so bold, pray, as\n",
      "to ask you what you are in Pursuit after, that shuns the Touch of\n",
      "any Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex. 'Tis, Sir, said she, the\n",
      "_Basilisk_: A _Basilisk_, Madam, said he! And pray, if you will be\n",
      "so good as to inform me, with what View, are you searching after a\n",
      "Creature so very difficult to be met with? 'Tis, Sir, said she, for\n",
      "our Lord and Master _Ogul_, whose Castle, you see, situate on the\n",
      "River-side, at the Bottom of the Meadow. We are all his Vassals.\n",
      "_Ogul_, you must know, is in a very bad State of Health, and his\n",
      "first Physician has order'd him, as a Specific, to eat a _Basilisk_,\n",
      "boil'd in Rose water: And as that Animal is very hard to be catch'd,\n",
      "and will suffer nothing to approach it, but one of our Sex, our\n",
      "dying Sovereign _Ogul_ has promis'd to honour her, that shall be so\n",
      "happy as to catch it for him, so far as to make her his Consort. The\n",
      "Case, being thus circumstantiated, Sir, I hope you will not\n",
      "interrupt me any longer, lest my Rivals here in the Field should\n",
      "happen to circumvent me.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ withdrew, and left the _Syrian_ Ladies in Quest of their\n",
      "imaginary Booty, in order to pursue his intended Journey. But as he\n",
      "came to the Banks of a Rivulet, at the remotest part of the Meadow,\n",
      "he perceiv'd another young Lady, reclin'd on the Grass, and entirely\n",
      "disengag'd. Her Stature seem'd majestic, but her Face was cover'd\n",
      "with a Vail; and her Eyes were fixt, as one at her Looking-glass, on\n",
      "the River. Every now and then a Sigh burst out, as if her Heart were\n",
      "breaking. In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod, with which she\n",
      "was tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand, that lay between\n",
      "the flow'ry Bank she sat on, and the purling Current. _Zadig's_\n",
      "Curiosity induc'd him, unperceiv'd, to observe her Operations at\n",
      "some Distance. But approaching nearer, and perceiving very\n",
      "distinctly the first Character to be an _Z_. the next an _A_. and\n",
      "the third a _D_. he started; but when he saw the additional Capitals\n",
      "of _I_ and _G_. his Astonishment was too great for Words to express.\n",
      "He stood for some Time perfectly thunder-struck, and as motionless\n",
      "as a Statue; At last, in a soft, faultring Tone, he broke Silence: O\n",
      "generous Lady, said he, forgive a Stranger, one overwhelm'd with\n",
      "Sorrows like yourself, if he asks you, by what amazing Accident he\n",
      "finds the Name of _Zadig_ delineated by so angelick a Hand. Thus\n",
      "unexpectedly interrupted, and at the Sound of those Words, she\n",
      "turn'd her Head; and with a trembling Hand, lifting up her Vail, she\n",
      "espy'd _Zadig_ himself. Upon which, she shriek'd; and as her Heart\n",
      "was flutter'd between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize,\n",
      "she fainted away, and gently dropp'd into his Arms. 'Twas, it seems\n",
      "_Astarte_ her self; 'twas the Queen of _Babylon_; 'twas the very\n",
      "_Goddess_ whom _Zadig_ ador'd; 'twas, in short, the very identical\n",
      "Lady, whose hard Fate he had so long deplor'd; and for whose sake he\n",
      "had felt so many agonizing Pains. For a few Minutes he stood\n",
      "speechless, and depriv'd, as it were, of all his senses, whilst his\n",
      "Eyes were fixt on his _Astarte_, who began to revive; and cast a\n",
      "wishful Glance at him, attended with some Confusion. O ye immortal\n",
      "Powers, cried he, who preside over the Destiny of us frail Mortals!\n",
      "Ye have restor'd me my _Astarte_; but alas! at what a Conjuncture,\n",
      "in what a Place, and in what a State and Condition do I view her? He\n",
      "threw himself prostrate on the Ground, and kiss'd the Dust of her\n",
      "Feet. The Queen of _Babylon_ rais'd him up, and oblig'd him to sit\n",
      "by her on the flow'ry Bank whereon she was repos'd. Every now and\n",
      "then she wip'd her Eyes, as the Tears trickl'd down afresh her\n",
      "lovely Cheeks. Twenty times she endeavour'd to renew her Discourse;\n",
      "but was interrupted by her Sighs; she ask'd him over and over to\n",
      "relate to her the Hardships he had ran thro' since their parting,\n",
      "and by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow; but\n",
      "prevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer, by\n",
      "repeating Question upon Question. At last, she gave him a particular\n",
      "Detail of her own Misfortunes, and again requested to know his. Both\n",
      "of them, in short, having, in some Measure, appeas'd the Tumult of\n",
      "their Souls; _Zadig_, in a few Words, inform'd her of the Motives\n",
      "that brought him thither.\n",
      "\n",
      "But tell me, O unfortunate, tho' ever-venerable Queen, how I came to\n",
      "find you out, reclining on this verdant Bank, dress'd in this\n",
      "servile Habit, accompanied by other Female Slaves, who, I find, have\n",
      "been all Day long in Quest after a _Basilisk_, which, as I\n",
      "understand, is by Order of a celebrated Physician, to be dissolv'd\n",
      "in Rose-water, as a specific Medicine for his dying Patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst they busy in their fruitless Search, said the beauteous\n",

      "undergone since last we parted; and since Heav'n has thus\n",
      "unexpectedly blest my Eyes once more with the Sight of my dear\n",
      "_Zadig_, I'll no longer exclaim against my impropitious Stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not insensible, that the jealous King my Spouse, was\n",
      "disgusted to find you the most amiable of all Mortals, and that for\n",
      "no other Reason he determin'd to strangle you, and poison me. You\n",
      "know very well too, that indulgent Heav'n inspir'd, as it were, my\n",
      "little Dwarf, with artful Means to give me timely Notice of the rash\n",
      "Resolutions of the King, my cruel Husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and\n",
      "to fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead\n",
      "of Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me\n",
      "directly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who\n",
      "was his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that\n",
      "stands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,\n",
      "touches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or\n",
      "rather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and\n",
      "furnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and\n",
      "loyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of\n",
      "Day into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,\n",
      "black Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.\n",
      "Whilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus\n",
      "employ'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with\n",
      "the silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us\n",
      "were fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the\n",
      "more artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us\n",
      "both, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that\n",
      "Villain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;\n",
      "and your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to\n",
      "_Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never\n",
      "expos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in\n",
      "the Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they\n",
      "had no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as\n",
      "it had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all\n",
      "Probability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on\n",
      "the Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very\n",
      "disconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to\n",
      "themselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her\n",
      "Complaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their\n",
      "gross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but\n",
      "after he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was\n",
      "extremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I\n",
      "have been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language\n",
      "signifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as\n",
      "much Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In\n",
      "short, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple\n",
      "in publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far\n",
      "in her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of\n",
      "a perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in\n",
      "her Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She\n",
      "insisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a\n",
      "Saraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so\n",
      "preposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing\n",
      "would serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand\n",
      "Master of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took\n",
      "the Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,\n",
      "however, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his\n",
      "Place for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of\n",
      "the Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and\n",
      "made her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and\n",
      "Confidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of\n",
      "_Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.\n",
      "The King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he\n",
      "would have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd\n",
      "all his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.\n",
      "He came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I\n",
      "saw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was\n",
      "enclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings\n",
      "on his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but\n",
      "hollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of\n",
      "Kings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant\n",
      "o'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent\n",
      "Wife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._\n",
      "_Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he\n",
      "ador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle\n",
      "that I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new\n",
      "Spouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In\n",
      "short, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which\n",
      "seem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His\n",
      "Subjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.\n",
      "_Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,\n",
      "became the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was\n",
      "taken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up\n",
      "at the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to\n",
      "_Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to\n",
      "_Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine\n",
      "Broils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third\n",
      "Party, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with\n",
      "his fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was\n",
      "so closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his\n",
      "Retreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for\n",
      "my own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and\n",
      "taken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the\n",
      "Presence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_\n",
      "stood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the\n",
      "Prince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but\n",
      "then, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd\n",
      "me to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that\n",
      "as soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,\n",
      "which would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would\n",
      "honour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was\n",
      "under, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations\n",
      "to _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of\n",
      "_Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a\n",
      "_Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of\n",
      "my high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that\n",
      "Heav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of\n",
      "Majesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an\n",
      "angry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those\n",
      "audacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I\n",
      "talk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile\n",
      "Domestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me\n",
      "one Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was\n",
      "very impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very\n",
      "pretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,\n",
      "and put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one\n",
      "of his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which\n",
      "was somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a\n",
      "little Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive\n",
      "him, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,\n",
      "I would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like\n",
      "me, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;\n",
      "and then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man\n",
      "would part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her\n",
      "gilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of\n",
      "the Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly\n",
      "devoted to her _Zadig_!\n",
      "\n",
      "At these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and\n",
      "bath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the\n",
      "most courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her\n",
      "Narration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the\n",
      "Tyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a\n",
      "Slave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in\n",
      "_Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and\n",
      "Place, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute\n",
      "Circumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in\n",
      "her Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in\n",
      "_Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.\n",
      "Beauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier\n",
      "Disposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young\n",
      "Prince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out\n",
      "some Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady\n",
      "Regent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly\n",
      "Assistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,\n",
      "(cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took\n",
      "care to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an\n",
      "old _Egyptian_ Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious\n",
      "Free-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was\n",
      "strolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to\n",
      "yonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He\n",
      "purchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I\n",
      "was. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good\n",
      "Eating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty\n",
      "sent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his\n",
      "unruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every\n",
      "Moment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so\n",
      "unmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can\n",
      "persuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at\n",
      "him, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has\n",
      "intimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing\n",
      "will restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon\n",
      "the grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,\n",
      "whoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,\n",
      "for him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I\n",
      "have others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a\n",
      "less Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since\n",
      "I have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth\n",
      "the virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;\n",
      "and reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in\n",
      "Distress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over\n",
      "all the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy\n",
      "and Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended\n",
      "on _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was\n",
      "fruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be\n",
      "introduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address\n",
      "was to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from\n",
      "Heaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a\n",
      "Physician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of\n",
      "the dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_\n",
      "with me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour\n",
      "of your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I\n",
      "request, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has\n",
      "been in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to\n",
      "be your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most\n",
      "illustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly\n",
      "discharg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,\n",
      "according to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear\n",
      "every Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new\n",
      "Patient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very\n",
      "affectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to\n",
      "each other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it\n",
      "is written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable\n",
      "_Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of\n",
      "Affection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure\n",
      "Dictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a\n",

      "In the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;\n",

      "all its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;\n",
      "I have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,\n",
      "full-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must\n",

      "under, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest\n",
      "Endeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an\n",
      "Adept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was\n",
      "ready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with\n",
      "the Fatigue. The second Day did not prove altogether so irksome, and\n",
      "he slept much better at Night than he had done before. In short, our\n",
      "Doctor in about eight Days Time, perform'd an absolute Cure. His\n",

      "Youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Sir, said _Zadig_, I'll be ingenuous with you, and disclose to\n",

      "Days successively; and you have liv'd all that Time, within the\n",
      "Bounds of Sobriety and Moderation. Know, Sir, that there is no such\n",

      "in all Respects, as idle and chimerical, as those of the\n",

      "The Queen was receiv'd at _Babylon_ with all the Transports of Joy\n",
      "that could possibly be express'd for the safe Return of so\n",
      "illustrious and so beautiful a Personage, that had run thro' such a\n",
      "long Series of Misfortunes. _Babylon_ at that Time seem'd to be\n",
      "perfectly serene and quiet. As for the young Prince of _Hyrcania_,\n",
      "he was slain in Battle. The _Babylonians_, who were the Victors,\n",
      "declar'd that _Astarte_ should marry that Candidate for the Crown,\n",
      "who should gain it by a fair and impartial Election. They were\n",
      "determin'd, that the most valuable Post of Honour in the World,\n",
      "namely, that of being the Royal Consort of _Astarte_, and the\n",
      "Sovereign of _Babylon_, should be the Result of Merit only; and not\n",
      "be procur'd by any Party-Factions or Court-Intrigues. A solemn Oath\n",
      "was voluntarily taken by all Parties, that he who should distinguish\n",
      "himself by his superior Valour and Wisdom, should unanimously be\n",
      "acknowledg'd the Sovereign-Elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spacious _List_, or _Circus_, was pitched upon, surrounded with\n",
      "commodious Seats, erected in an Amphitheatrical Manner, and richly\n",
      "embellish'd some few Leagues from the City. Thither the Combatants,\n",
      "or Champions were to repair, compleatly accoutred. Each of them had\n",
      "a distinct Apartment to himself behind the _Lists_, where no Soul\n",
      "could either see them, or know who they were. They were to enter the\n",
      "_Lists_ four several Times. Those who were so happy as to conquer\n",
      "four Competitors, were afterwards to engage each other in single\n",
      "Combat; in order that he who should remain Master of the Field\n",
      "should be proclaim'd the happy Victor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four Days afterwards, they were to meet again, accoutred as before,\n",
      "and to explain all such _Ænigmas_, or _Riddles_, as the _Magi_\n",
      "should think proper to propose. If their Queries should prove too\n",
      "intricate and perplext for them to resolve, they were to have\n",
      "Recourse to the _Lists_ again, and after that, to fresh _Ænigmas_,\n",
      "before they could be entitled to the Election: So that the\n",
      "_Tournaments_ were to be continu'd till One of the Candidates should\n",
      "be twice a Victor, and shine as conspicuous, with respect to his\n",
      "internal Qualities, as to his Dexterity and Address in heroic\n",
      "Atchievements. The Queen, in the mean Time, was to be narrowly\n",
      "watch'd, and allow'd only to be a Spectator of both their\n",
      "Amusements, at some considerable Distance; and moreover, to be\n",
      "cover'd with a Vail: Nor was she indulg'd so far as to speak one\n",
      "single Word to any Candidate whomsoever, in order to prevent the\n",
      "least Jealousy or Suspicion either of Partiality or Injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Astarte_ took care, by the Courier, to inform her Lover of all the\n",

      "the other Competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ accordingly set out for _Babylon_, and besought the Goddess\n",
      "_Venus_, not only to fortify his Courage, but to illuminate his Mind\n",
      "with Wisdom on this important Occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Night before these martial Atchievements were to commence,\n",
      "_Zadig_ arrived upon the Banks of the _Euphrates_. He inscrib'd his\n",
      "Device amongst the List of Combatants; concealing, at the same Time,\n",
      "both his Person and Name, as the Laws of the Election required; and\n",
      "accordingly, withdrew to the Apartment that was provided for him,\n",
      "according to his Lot.\n",

      "_Cador_, who was just return'd to _Babylon_, having hunted all\n",
      "_Egypt_ over to no Purpose, in Hopes to find his Friend _Zadig_,\n",
      "brought a compleat set of Armour into his Lodge, by express Orders\n",
      "from the Queen: She sent him likewise One of the finest Horses in\n",
      "all _Persia_. _Zadig_ knew that these Presents could come from\n",
      "No-body but his dear _Astarte_, which redoubled his Vigour and his\n",
      "Hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Morning the Queen being seated under a Canopy of State,\n",
      "enrich'd with precious Stones; and the Amphitheatres being crowded\n",
      "with Gentlemen and Ladies of all Ranks and Conditions from\n",
      "_Babylon_; the Competitors made their personal Appearance in the\n",
      "_Circus_: Each of them went up to the grand _Magus_, and laid down\n",
      "his particular _Device_ at his Feet. The _Devices_ were drawn by\n",
      "Lot: That of _Zadig_ was the last. The first that advanc'd was a\n",
      "Grandee, one _Itabod_ by Name, immensely rich, indeed, and very\n",
      "haughty; but no ways couragious; exceedingly awkward, and a Man of\n",
      "no acquir'd Parts. The Sycophants that hover'd round about him\n",
      "flatter'd him, that a Man of his Merit couldn't fail of being King:\n",
      "He imperiously replied, One of my Merit must be King: Whereupon he\n",
      "was arm'd _Cap-a-pee_. His Armour was made of pure Gold, enamell'd\n",
      "with Green. The Housings of his Saddle were green, and his Lance\n",
      "embellish'd with green Ribbands. Every One was sensible, at first\n",
      "Sight, by _Itobad's_ Manner of managing his Horse, that he was not\n",
      "the Man whom Heav'n had pitch'd upon to sway the _Babylonish_\n",
      "Scepter. The first Combatant that tilted with him, threw him out of\n",
      "the Saddle; the second flung him quite over the Crupper, and laid\n",
      "him sprawling on the Ground, with his Heels quiv'ring in the Air.\n",
      "_Itobad_, 'tis true, remounted, but with so ill a Grace, that an\n",
      "universal Laugh went round the Amphitheatre. The third, disdaining\n",
      "to use his Lance, made only a Feint at him: Then catch'd hold of his\n",
      "Right Leg, and whirling him round, threw him flat upon the Sand. The\n",
      "Esquires, who were the Attendants, ran to his Assistance, and with a\n",
      "Sneer remounted him. The fourth Combatant catch'd hold of his Left\n",
      "Leg, and unhors'd him again. He was convey'd thro' the hissing\n",
      "Multitude to his Lodge, where, according to the Law in that Case\n",
      "provided, he was to pass the Night. And as he hobbled along, said\n",
      "he, to the Esquires, what a sad Misfortune is this to One of my\n",
      "Birth and Character!\n",
      "\n",
      "The other Champions play'd their Parts much better; and all came off\n",
      "with Credit. Some conquer'd two of their Antagonists, and others\n",
      "were so far successful as to get the better of three. None of them,\n",
      "however, except Prince _Hottam_, vanquish'd four. _Zadig_, at last,\n",
      "enter'd the Lists, and dismounted all his four Opponents, one after\n",
      "the other, with the utmost Ease, and with such an Air and Grace, as\n",
      "gain'd him universal Applause. As the Case stood thus, _Zadig_ and\n",
      "_Hottam_ were to close the Day's Entertainment in a single Combat.\n",
      "The Armour of the latter was of a blue Colour mixt with Gold, and\n",
      "the Housings of his Saddle were of the same. Those of the former\n",
      "white as Snow. The Multitude were divided in their Wishes. The\n",
      "Knight in blue was the Favourite of some of the Ladies; and others\n",
      "again were Admirers of the Cavalier in white. The Queen, whose Heart\n",
      "was in a perfect Palpitation, put up her secret Prayers to _Venus_\n",
      "to assist her darling Hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Champions making their Passes and their Volta's, with the\n",
      "utmost Dexterity and Address, and keeping firm in their Saddles,\n",
      "gave each other such Rebuffs with their Lances, that all the\n",
      "Spectators (the Queen only excepted) wish'd for two Kings of\n",
      "_Babylon_. At last, their Horses being tired, and both their Lances\n",
      "broke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his\n",
      "Antagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,\n",
      "and shooting with a Spring on his Horses Buttocks, grasp'd him\n",
      "close, threw him headlong on the Sand, then jump'd into his Seat,\n",
      "and wheel'd round Prince _Hottam_, while he lay sprawling on the\n",
      "Ground. All the Spectators in general, with loud Acclamations, cried\n",
      "out, Victory! Victory! in favour of the Champion in white. _Hottam_,\n",
      "incens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_\n",
      "sprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the\n",
      "two Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!\n",
      "where they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for\n",
      "both were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their\n",
      "Helmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew\n",
      "about in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times\n",
      "repeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their\n",
      "Swords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the\n",
      "Right, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they\n",
      "retreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd\n",
      "again; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two\n",
      "Serpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions\n",
      "fighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every\n",
      "Blow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment\n",
      "or two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,\n",
      "threw him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried\n",
      "out, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd\n",
      "to be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.\n",
      "The two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the\n",
      "others had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.\n",
      "Several Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them\n",
      "some proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the\n",
      "Queen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy\n",
      "Occasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants\n",
      "to rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the\n",
      "Victor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in\n",
      "order to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the\n",
      "Queen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge\n",
      "contiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He\n",
      "got up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,\n",
      "and substituted his green One in its Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly\n",
      "undaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was\n",
      "the mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he\n",
      "gain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was\n",
      "awake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,\n",
      "return'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of\n",
      "_Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the\n",
      "Amphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could\n",
      "find nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against\n",
      "his Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear\n",
      "in: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made\n",
      "his personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace\n",
      "that were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he\n",
      "took, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks\n",
      "of Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was\n",
      "never sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite\n",
      "out of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,\n",
      "with his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,\n",
      "or how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to\n",
      "have a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour\n",
      "again which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the\n",
      "Engagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:\n",
      "Thus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so\n",
      "on the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and\n",
      "Resentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks\n",
      "of the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star\n",
      "had shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes\n",
      "were irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments\n",
      "from his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd\n",
      "an utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white\n",

      "As _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey\n",
      "and venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a\n",
      "little Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in\n",
      "his Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the\n",
      "Compliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that\n",
      "_Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a\n",
      "Stranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the\n",
      "Treatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the\n",
      "Hermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put\n",
      "the Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect\n",
      "Master of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.\n",
      "This rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the\n",
      "good Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If\n",
      "you'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I\n",
      "may be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments\n",
      "of Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret\n",
      "Regard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He\n",
      "found, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person\n",
      "he had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,\n",
      "Morality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and\n",
      "Vice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that\n",
      "_Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd\n",
      "earnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.\n",
      "That Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to\n",
      "me by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,\n",
      "let me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both\n",
      "pursu'd their Journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The\n",
      "Hermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young\n",
      "Comrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,\n",
      "let them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he\n",
      "conducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every\n",
      "rich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper\n",
      "afterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they\n",
      "were taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd\n",
      "with as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.\n",
      "When they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden\n",
      "Bason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to\n",
      "go to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;\n",
      "and the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for\n",
      "their mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were\n",
      "dismiss'd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the\n",
      "Road, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat\n",
      "too haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out\n",
      "of his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's\n",
      "Garment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon\n",
      "saw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off\n",
      "the Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;\n",
      "but was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the\n",
      "Hermit rapp'd at a petty Cottage with his Staff, the beggarly\n",
      "Residence of an old, rich Miser. He desir'd that he and his\n",
      "Companion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,\n",
      "shabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,\n",
      "and carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few\n",
      "musty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit\n",
      "seem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At\n",
      "last, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old\n",
      "Valet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they\n",
      "had been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that\n",
      "he fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of\n",
      "Gold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his\n",
      "Gratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I\n",
      "would willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The\n",
      "Valet, thunder-struck at his unexpected Gratuity, comply'd with his\n",
      "Request: Most hospitable Sir, said the Hermit, I couldn't go away\n",
      "without returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly\n",
      "Reception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this\n",
      "Golden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser\n",
      "started, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so\n",
      "valuable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of\n",
      "his Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.\n",
      "Father, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to\n",
      "me to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of\n",
      "Mankind. You plunder One, who entertain'd you with all the Pomp and\n",
      "Profusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who\n",
      "treated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that\n",
      "Grandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than\n",
      "to gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the\n",
      "Furniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and\n",
      "the Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be\n",
      "surpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and\n",
      "couldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater\n",
      "Wisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an\n",
      "Ascendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he\n",
      "couldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very\n",
      "commodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,\n",
      "and yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had\n",
      "retir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his\n",
      "Mind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the\n",
      "Reception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without\n",
      "Ostentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a\n",
      "Time, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious\n",
      "Apartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet\n",
      "elegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the\n",
      "late Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the\n",
      "Queen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the\n",
      "Lists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a\n",
      "King of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at\n",
      "this unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his\n",
      "Misfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this\n",
      "World took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest\n",
      "Patriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence\n",
      "are often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for\n",
      "casting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare\n",
      "Inspection of the minutest Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said\n",
      "_Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,\n",
      "they are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,\n",
      "'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing\n",
      "without them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then\n",
      "there is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is\n",
      "dangerous, yet All are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and\n",
      "the Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,\n",
      "said he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he\n",
      "receives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,\n",
      "proceed from a superior Cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such\n",
      "vile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the\n",
      "proper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry\n",
      "way agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,\n",
      "thanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers\n",
      "to his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to\n",
      "defray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect\n",
      "and Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.\n",
      "The Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd\n",
      "to set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very\n",
      "affectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more\n",
      "than common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the\n",
      "Hermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in\n",
      "Praise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old\n",
      "Hermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but\n",
      "as all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my\n",
      "Respect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words\n",
      "out of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set\n",
      "the Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd\n",
      "out, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of\n",
      "such a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by\n",
      "a superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got\n",
      "at a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,\n",
      "turn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,\n",
      "our fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense\n",
      "Treasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his\n",
      "Beneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.\n",
      "_Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their\n",
      "last Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and\n",
      "well-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of\n",
      "Age. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She\n",
      "entertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House\n",
      "afforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an\n",
      "adjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days\n",
      "before, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When\n",
      "they were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the\n",
      "Hermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her\n",
      "last Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair\n",
      "of his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went\n",
      "the little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;\n",
      "but was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of\n",
      "Villains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to\n",
      "view my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd\n",
      "but one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who\n",
      "told you so, you barbarous Wretch, said _Zadig_? And when did you\n",
      "read that inhuman Event in your _Black-Book_ of _Fate_? Who gave you\n",
      "Permission pray, to drown so innocent a Youth, that had never\n",
      "disoblig'd you?\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had our young _Babylonian_ ceas'd his severe Reflections,\n",
      "but he perceiv'd that the old Hermit's long Beard grew shorter and\n",
      "shorter; that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up, and that his\n",
      "Cheeks glow'd with a Rose-coloured Red, as if he had been in the\n",
      "Bloom of Fifteen. His Mantle was vanish'd at once; and on his\n",
      "Shoulders, which were before cover'd, appear'd four angelic Wings,\n",
      "each refulgent as the Sun. O thou Messenger of Heaven! O thou\n",
      "angelic Form! cry'd _Zadig_, and fell prostrate at his Feet; thou\n",
      "art descended from the Empireum, I find, to instruct such a poor\n",
      "frail Mortal as I am, how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate.\n",
      "Mankind in general, said the Angel _Jesrad_, judge of the Whole, by\n",
      "only viewing the hither Link of the Chain. Thou, of all the human\n",
      "Race, wast the only Man that deserv'd to have thy Mind enlighten'd.\n",
      "_Zadig_, begg'd Leave to speak. I am somewhat diffident of myself,\n",
      "'tis true; but may I presume, Sir, to beg the Solution of one\n",
      "Scruple? Would it not have been better to have chastiz'd the Lad,\n",
      "and by that Means reform'd him, than to have cut him off thus\n",
      "unprepar'd in a Moment. _Jesrad_, replied, had he been virtuous, and\n",
      "had he liv'd, 'twas his _Fate_ not only to be murder'd himself, but\n",
      "his Wife, whom he would afterwards have married, and the little\n",
      "Infant, that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection.\n",
      "Is it necessary then, venerable Guide, that there should be\n",
      "Wickedness and Misfortunes in the World, and that those Misfortunes\n",
      "should fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous? The Wicked,\n",
      "replied _Jesrad_, are always unhappy. Misfortunes are intended only\n",
      "as a Touch-stone, to try a small Number of the Just, who are thinly\n",
      "scatter'd about this terrestrial Globe: Besides, there is no Evil\n",
      "under the Sun, but some Good proceeds from it: But, said _Zadig_,\n",
      "Suppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in\n",
      "Nature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be\n",
      "another World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that\n",
      "other Order, which would be perfect, must of Necessity be the\n",
      "everlasting Residence of the supreme Being, whom no Evil can\n",
      "approach. That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number\n",
      "of Worlds, and no two of them alike. This vast Variety is an\n",
      "Attribute of his Omnipotence. There are not two Leaves on the Trees\n",
      "throughout the Universe, nor any two Globes of Light amongst the\n",
      "Myriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven, which are\n",
      "perfectly alike. And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth,\n",
      "whereof you are a Native, must exist in the Place, and at the Time\n",
      "appointed, according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends\n",
      "the Whole. Mankind imagine, that the Lad, whom I plung'd into the\n",
      "River, was drown'd by _Chance_; and that our generous Benefactor's\n",
      "House was reduc'd to Ashes by the same _Chance_; but know, there is\n",
      "no such Thing as _Chance_, all Misfortunes are intended, either as\n",
      "severe Trials, Judgments, or Rewards; and are the Result of\n",
      "Foreknowledge. You remember, Sir, the poor Fisherman in Despair,\n",
      "that thought himself the most unhappy Mortal breathing. The great\n",
      "_Orasmades_, sent you to amend his Situation. Frail Mortal! Cease to\n",
      "contend with what you ought to adore. But, said _Zadig_--whilst the\n",
      "Sound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue, the Angel took his\n",
      "Flight towards the tenth Sphere. _Zadig_ sunk down upon his Knees,\n",
      "and acknowledg'd an over-ruling Providence with all the Marks of the\n",
      "profoundest Submission. The Angel, as he was soaring towards the\n",

      "on that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd\n",
      "in the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious\n",
      "Outer-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the Ænigmas, and give\n",
      "the wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand\n",
      "Magus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,\n",
      "except the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made\n",
      "his Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about\n",
      "him: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were\n",
      "lavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their\n",
      "Sovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a\n",
      "deep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud\n",
      "Acclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had\n",
      "heard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and\n",
      "Despair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she\n",
      "couldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his\n",
      "Accoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the\n",
      "snow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran\n",
      "thro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the\n",
      "same Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into\n",
      "the Assembly-Room except the Knights.\n",

      "I have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,\n",

      "I can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into\n",
      "Court, in order to give my Solutions to such Ænigmas as shall be\n",
      "propos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a\n",
      "Man of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted\n",
      "on their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the\n",
      "Affirmative, without the least Opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the\n",
      "longest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and\n",
      "the most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least\n",
      "valu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can\n",
      "possibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute\n",
      "soever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,\n",
      "however Great?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man\n",
      "of his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;\n",
      "'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the\n",
      "Circus. One said, the Solution of the Ænigma propos'd was _Fortune_;\n",
      "others said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_\n",
      "pronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since\n",
      "'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is\n",
      "Time always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so\n",
      "slowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as\n",
      "Time to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's\n",
      "Extent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in\n",
      "part. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of\n",

      "buries in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to\n",
      "Posterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The\n",

    "Our project is mainly based on the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which leverage computational linguistics to comprehend, recognize and interpret human text for analysis. This approach was applied to “Zadig; or the Book of Faith” a philosophical book written by Voltaire in 1747. In this process, data loading, cleaning, pre-processing and analysis were employed to understand the distribution of parts of speech (POS) in our chosen text. Indeed, our methodology involved selecting a dataset to download and processing, opening the text file to clean and pre-process the content by using tokenization methods to ensure the preservation of linguistic context. Then, we conducted analysis using POS tagging to explore occurences and proportions. Finally, we represented those POS proportions in a barplot, which revealed a dominance in nouns, prepositions, pronouns, adverbs and adjectives, aligning with characteristics  reminiscent of Old English literature.

    "Natural Language Processing (NLP), is a set of studies that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language (IBM, n.d). By manipulating human language through computational linguistics, with statistical and machine learning models, NLP enables and facilitates computers understanding, recognition and interpretation of human text in order to analyse textual data and extract meaningful insights from it (DeepLearning.AI, 2023). Our assignment consists in analysing “Zadig; or the Book of Faith”, a philosophical fiction published by the French Enlightenment writer Voltaire in 1747 (Global Grey, no date). Through our programme solution, we aim to perform data cleaning and pre-processing to identify and analyse the proportion of each part of speech (POS) and create a graph to visualize our results. Therefore, this report will shed light on the different steps undertaken to find the distribution and proportion of each POS within the narrative. "

    "Then, we created a variable “zadig_url”, which we assign to its corresponding url from Project Gutenberg. This way, we displayed our stored text file url into our console for further processing.\n",
    "Subsequently, we defined our download function designed to retrieve our chosen text data from its specified url and save it to our folder. This function took 4 parameters; the url from which to download data (previously generated), the folder where the downloaded file will be saved,  the specific name we will be giving to our file, and the character encoding scheme used to represent the text. If the filename was not provided, we asked the function to extract it from its url, and create a filepath where the downloaded file will be saved, by joining the specified folder and the determined filename. Then, we asked the function to check if the file already existed in the specified location. If it did, the function prints a message, and returns the filepath without downloading the file again. If it did not exist, the function prints a message indicating the start of the download, including the name of the file and its location. We also asked the function to record the current time (t0) and to attempt to retrieve the file from the specified url. If a keyboard interrupt occurs during the download, the function removes the partially downloaded file before raising the interrupt again. The function calculates the time taken for the download (dt), prints a completion message with the time duration and returns the filepath of the downloaded file.\n",
    "Once defined, we downloaded the required data from our url link, and opened our downloaded file in read mode as a first_file by specifying the character encoding  “UTF-8”, we assigned it to our “text” variable, which we printed into our console for further processing. \n",
    "Finally, prior to delving into our program solution,  we wanted to check whether our text contained a minimum length of 10 000 words. To do that, we used the split method on our “text” variable defined above, which segmented it into a list of words separated by whitespace characters. We then assigned this list of words to our “split_text” variable, applied the len() function to determine its length, as it correspond to the number of words in our text. We stored the previous in our “text_length” variable, printed it and confirmed our text word count. \n",
    "\n",
    "***b)Data cleaning and preprocessing:***\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to clean our text, we removed all the unnecessary preamble on the downloaded text to only keep our required text. To do that, we defined our “extract_text” function which identifies the text start and end, and extracts it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, our extract_text function works with 3 parameters, our text input defined previously, and the start and end marker determined by the “re.search” method. This method finds the starting and ending indices of our “text_start” and “text_end” within our text, storing them into “start_indice” and “end_indice” variables. An if statement is used in order to check whether both indices are found, leading to the extraction of our required text in between these indices from our original text. If either marker is not found, the function returns the original text. Once the function defined, we specified our start and end markers using the “re.escape” function to ensure the proper handling of  any special characters. We then called our “extract_text” function resulting in our required “new_text” displayed into our console. \n",
    "Upon further examination, we realised that our “new_text” contained urls and hyperlinks, which necessitate their removal as part of our data cleaning process. To do that, we used the “re.compile” function to create a “url_pattern” that matches urls and hyperlinks. Indeed, the “https?” matches the prefix “http” or “https”, the “://” matches the colon and double slash following the http, the “/S+” matches the non-whitespace characters, which represent the remainder of the url or hyperlink. We then used the “sub()” method which replaces all occurences of the “url_pattern” within our “new_text” with an empty string. This is stored in our new variable “free_text”, that we printed into our console, resulting  in our “new_text” without the urls and hyperlinks. \n",
    "Moreover, we proceeded to remove any punctuation from our “free_text”. Prior to it,  we first tokenized our text, breaking it down into sentences then words. As punctuation marks carry meaning and contribute to the grammatical structure of a sentence we preserved these characters as individual tokens as well as the meaning of each sentences.  Indeed, we enabled the understanding of our text structure and meaning at a broader level and avoided the ambiguity of words by providing context in which they appear (this will be useful for our POS tagging tasks). \n",
    "Sentence tokenization involves downloading the “punkt” resource from the imported NLTK module, which is a pre-trained tokenizer model for languages that allows the division of a text into a list of sentences (NLTK, 2024).Then, from the NLTK tokenize module we imported the “”sent_tokenize” function that allowed us to break down a text into a list of sentences. We applied the latter to our variable “free_text” and stored our result into our “tokenized_sentences” variable, which we printed to our console. Then, we imported the “word_tokenize” function from the NLTK library, to break down each sentence into a list of words. We applied it to each sentence within our “ tokenized_sentence” list, printed our results stored into our “tokenized_words” variable. \n",
    "Finally, now that we tokenized our text per sentences, then per words, we can remove the punctuations marks. To do that, we firstly identify the  punctuation characters for removal, by printing the string containing punctuation characters. Then, we removed all the characters of the above string.punctuation from our tokenized_words list by creating a translation table to replace all the punctuation characters with “None” (IBM, 2015). This is done by using the “str.maketrans” method that maps every punctuation characters to “None”, hence removing them from our list. So for each word in a sentence, the “translate()” method is applied, removing any punctuation from each word in every sentence. This resulted in a new list of tokenized words without punctuation, stored in our “cleaned_text” variable, and printed into our console. \n",
    "\n",
    "***c)Analysis:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we initiate the processing of POS tagging in our “cleaned_text”, meaning that we will label each word to its corresponding POS. To do that, we first imported the “pos_tag” module from NLTK to perform POS tagging on a list of words. Indeed, we converted our nested list of sentences into a single list that named “cleantokenized_list” , using “word_tokenize” function, which resulted in a single list of words to use POS tagging on it. Finally, we use the “pos_tag_sents” function to perform POS tagging on our list of tokenized words, referred to as “words”. This resulted in our “tagged_words_list”, which once printed, displayed our tagged words into the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculated the proportion of POS identified in our text. Initially, we identified all the POS types present in our text. To do that, we iterated through each sentence in our “tagged_words_list” and each “word_pos_tuple” in each sentence. Considering only tuples with both word and POS tag (len(word_pos_tuple) ==2), we collected the POS tags (word_pos_tuple[1]) into our new list called “tagged_words”. We then applied to the latter the “set()” function to generate a unique set of POS type, which we printed to our console through a for loop iterating through the set of “pos_types”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, we determined the count of each POS type by importing the Counter class from “collection” module, which allows to count the occurences of elements in a set (Python documentation, 2024). Therefore, the counter class is applied to our “tagged_words” list creating our “pos_count” variable, which is a dictionary where POS type and their corresponding values are stored. The occurences of each POS type are printed to the console through a for loop that iterates through the “pos_count” dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we defined the proportion of each POS type in our dataset “tagged_words”. To do that, we first calculated the total number of words in our dataset through the “len()” function of our “tagged_words” list. Then, we calculated the proportion of each POS type by dividing each POS type “pos_count” dictionary by the total number of words (“total_words”). This resulted in a dictionary named “pos_proportions” that contains POS type with their corresponding proportions. The proportion of each POS type is printed into the console by using a for loop to iterate through the items of “pos_proportions” dictionary. The output is a percentage with 2 decimal places. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***d)Visualisation:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate step involved generating a barplot that contains all the POS tags types present in our text and their corresponding proportions. To do that, we created a pandas dataframe called “dataset” from our “pos_proportions” dictionary. This dataset contains one column for the type of POS and the other for their corresponding proportions. Then, we sorted the dataframe by proportion in descending order, and created a barplot using seaborn, having each POS type on the x-axis and each proportion on the y-axis. Then, we added a text label displaying each proportion of each bar and customized the appearance of our barplot, included labels, title and axis rotation before displaying it. "

    "From our depicted barplot, we noticed that the highest and most significant proportion of POS in our text is for nouns, accounting for 27.71%, followed by prepositions at 13.95%, determiner at 10.8%, personal pronouns at 6.54%, and adjectives at 4.96% closely followed by adverbs at 4.78%. The subsequent categories include, plural noun (4.45%), past tense verbs (4.02%), coordinate conjunction (3.89%), possessive pronouns (3.87%), ‘to’ (2.85%), verbs (5.6%), proper nouns (1.12%), modals (1.12%), cardinal digits (0.77%), verb in present tense (3rd person) (0.74%), wh-pronouns (0.66%), superlative adjectives (0.49%), present tense (0.40%), wh-adverbs (0.39%), wh-determiner (0.39%), comparative adverbs (0.33%), comparative adjectives (0.06%), possessive wh-pronoun (0.05%), existential “there” (0.02%) and interjections (0.02%), collectively contributing less than 5% each, in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results, while surprising, seem to align with the dominance of nouns over verbs in our text. Notably, we noticed that the verb category is further divided into subcategories, which reflect the ability for NLPs to discern verbs conjugation into present or past tense. The overall verb content constitutes 10.78% of the total text. Similarly, nouns are subdivided into nouns and proper nouns, collectively forming 28.83% of the total text. Additionally, adjectives and adverbs each contribute to 5.51% and 5.5% respectively, while pronouns when combined, constitute 11.12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it is important to note that our text was originally written in French and that POS tags might differ in the original text, considering we are working with its translation. Indeed, the higher prevalence of nouns aligns with the characterisics of Old English literature, which according to the Oxford english dictionary (n.d), is usually distinguished by a large use of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. \n",
    "\n",
    "On another hand, please, note that prior to completing our programming solution, we first lowered all text cases but we realised that we lost values for  PRP, such as I, as well as our section for NNP/NNPS. We also wanted to remove any digits prior to tokenizing our text however, this would have skewed our data as the text contains 0.77% of cardinal digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, our text contains roman numerals to indicate chapters numbers, which should fall under cardinal digits, but are considered as nouns. Considering that there are 18 chapters, each written twice (in our table content and  at the beginning of each chapter), we can conclude that our noun proportion is skewed. Moreover, without tokenizing our text per sentence then per words, we would have lost some of the meaning of our words hence leading to a POS mis-tagging and skewed proportions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using our previous text word count, we can estimate the approximate number of words for each POS category.  The noun proportion equates to 9893 nouns, the preposition proportion equates to 4787 prepositions, 3816 pronouns, 3706 determiners, 3699 verbs, 1891 adjectives and 1887 adverbs. Please, keep in mind that our total word count is 34313 words prior to removing urls, hence the approximation. Indeed, we notice that there is a significant difference in each POS tag occurence, when we compare the proportion percentages to our task where we identify the occurence per POS type."

    "In conclusion, our programme solution consisted of using NLP methods through our chosen book, Zadig; or the Book of Faith by Voltaire. This has allowed us to clean, pre-process our data to visualize the distribution of each POS in our text. Indeed, our programme solution was able to specify the POS tags, however, we noticed that we could combine them into general types such as nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. By doing so, we concluded that the predominant proportion of our text words consisted of nouns, followed by preposition, pronouns, determiner, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. This makes sense as the book was translated from Old French to Old English literature.\n"
